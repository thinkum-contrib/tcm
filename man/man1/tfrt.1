.SH NAME
tfrt \- Tool for Function Refinement Trees 
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B tfrt
.RI [ options ]
.RI [ tree ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fItfrt\fP
is an X11/Motif based graphical editor for drawing function decomposition trees.
Trees can be loaded from and stored to a file. It can print
trees to a PostScript printer or save as PostScript to a file.

\fItfrt\fP is part of \fIThe Toolkit for Conceptual Modeling (TCM)\fP.

.SH ARGUMENTS
You can call \fItfrt\fP with a single tree name as argument. 
If this argument is an existing file then \fItfrt\fP
tries to load a tree from it. If it does not exist, a new tree
is created with the argument as tree name. \fItfrt\fP files should
have suffix '*.frt'.

Without a tree argument, \fItfrt\fP creates a new 
empty function decomposition tree with the name 'untitled.frt'.

In addition to the standard X11 toolkit options (see X11(7)) \fItfrt\fP accepts
the options listed below:
.TP
.B \-drawing \fIwidth\fPx\fIheight\fP
Create a drawing area of \fIwidth\fP pixels wide and
\fIheight\fP pixels high.
.TP
.B \-help
Write all available options to standard output and quit.
.TP
.B \-maxdrawing \fIwidth\fPx\fIheight\fP
The drawing area can not be larger than \fIwidth\fP pixels wide and
\fIheight\fP pixels high.
.TP
.B \-priv_cmap 
Start the editor with a private colormap.
.TP
.B \-projdir \fIdirectory\fP
Set the project directory (current working directory) to \fIdirectory\fP.
.TP
.B \-toEPS [\fIfile\fP.eps]
Generate EPS (to \fIfile\fP.eps or stdout when no file name was 
given) and quit.
.TP
.B \-toFig [\fIfile\fP.fig] [-latex]
Generate Fig format (to \fIfile\fP.fig or stdout when no file name was
given and quit. When the -latex option is given, LaTeX fonts are
generated, otherwise normal PostScript fonts are generated.
The Fig format can be read by xfig(1) and fig2dev(1).
.TP
.B \-toPNG \fIfile\fP.png
Generate PNG format to \fIfile\fP.png and quit.
.TP
.B \-toPS [\fIfile\fP.ps]
Generate PostScript (to \fIfile\fP.ps or stdout when no file name was
given) and quit.
.TP
.B \-version                
Write the TCM version to standard output and quit.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
The \fBTCM_HOME\fP environment variable should be the directory
where the TCM files are installed.
.TP
.B PATH   
Should include $TCM_HOME/bin
.TP
.B MANPATH
Should include $TCM_HOME/man
.TP
.B PRINTER
Name of the default printer that is used by \fItfrt\fP.
.TP
.B LD_LIBRARY_PATH 
Should include $TCM_HOME/lib
when the distribution contains shared
object libraries in $TCM_HOME/lib.

.SH FILES
The following relative files are relative to $TCM_HOME.
.TP
\fIbin/tfrt\fP 
the function decomposition tree editor.
.TP
\fIbin/psf\fP
a program to filter PostScript output.
.TP
\fIlib/banner.ps\fP
PostScript banner page that can be used when the printer
does not print a banner page.
.TP
\fIlib/help/*\fP
The help directory contains a collection of text files for
the on-line help.
.TP
\fIlib/TCM\fP
X Resources (the same as the ones that are built-in).
You can customize the fonts and colors by setting resources
in your X defaults database.  Each string of the form
``TCM.resource:definition'' sets a resource.
.TP
.I /tmp/tcmXXXXXX			
Pseudo random temporary file, for PostScript output.
.TP 
\fIlib/tcm.conf\fP
TCM editor configuration file. This file contains values
for some of the editor defaults like the page size, the default 
fonts etc. This file is read by each editor upon startup.
.TP
\fI$HOME/.tcmrc\fP
Each user of TCM can override some of the options of tcm.conf
by its own configuration file, installed in $HOME/.tcmrc.
