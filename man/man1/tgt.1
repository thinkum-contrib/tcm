.SH NAME
tgt \- Tool for Generic Tables 
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B tgt
.RI [ options ]
.RI [ document ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fItgt\fP
is an X11/Motif based graphical editor for drawing generic tables.
Documents can be loaded from and stored to a file. It can print
documents to a PostScript printer or save as PostScript to a file.

\fItgt\fP is part of \fIThe Toolkit for Conceptual Modeling (TCM)\fP.

.SH ARGUMENTS
You can call \fItgt\fP with a single document name as argument. 
If this argument is an existing file then \fItgt\fP
tries to load a document from it. If it does not exist, a new document
is created with the argument as document name. \fItgt\fP files should
have suffix '*.gt'.

Without a document name as argument, \fItgt\fP creates a new 
generic table with the name 'untitled.gt'.

In addition to the standard X11 toolkit options (see X11(7)) \fItgt\fP accepts
the options listed below:
.TP
.B \-cell \fIwidth\fPx\fIheight\fP
Sets the minimal cell size of the editor to \fIwidth\fP pixels
wide and \fIheight\fP pixels high. The cells in the initial table
have the minimal size.
.TP
.B \-drawing \fIwidth\fPx\fIheight\fP
Create a drawing area of \fIwidth\fP pixels wide and
\fIheight\fP pixels high.
.TP
.B \-help
Write all available options to standard output and quit.
.TP
.B \-maxdrawing \fIwidth\fPx\fIheight\fP
The drawing area can not be larger than \fIwidth\fP pixels wide and
\fIheight\fP pixels high.
.TP
.B \-priv_cmap 
Start the editor with a private colormap.
.TP
.B \-projdir \fIdirectory\fP
Set the project directory (current working directory) to \fIdirectory\fP.
.TP
.B \-table \fIrows\fPx\fIcolumns\fP
The table editor will be initialized with a table having \fIrows\fP
rows and \fIcolumns\fP columns. By default the initial table has
7 rows and 7 columns.
.TP
.B \-toEPS [\fIfile\fP.eps]
Generate EPS (to \fIfile\fP.eps or stdout when no file name was 
given) and quit.
.TP
.B \-toFig [\fIfile\fP.fig] [-latex]
Generate Fig format (to \fIfile\fP.fig or stdout when no file name was
given and quit. When the -latex option is given, LaTeX fonts are
generated, otherwise normal PostScript fonts are generated.
The Fig format can be read by xfig(1) and fig2dev(1).
.TP
.B \-toPNG \fIfile\fP.png
Generate PNG format to \fIfile\fP.png and quit.
.TP
.B \-toPS [\fIfile\fP.ps]
Generate PostScript (to \fIfile\fP.ps or stdout when no file name was
given) and quit.
.TP
.B \-version                
Write the TCM version to standard output and quit.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
The \fBTCM_HOME\fP environment variable should be the directory
where the TCM files are installed.
.TP
.B PATH   
Should include $TCM_HOME/bin
.TP
.B MANPATH
Should include $TCM_HOME/man
.TP
.B PRINTER
Name of the default printer that is used by \fItgt\fP.
.TP
.B LD_LIBRARY_PATH 
Should include $TCM_HOME/lib
when the distribution contains shared
object libraries in $TCM_HOME/lib.

.SH FILES
The following relative files are relative to $TCM_HOME.
.TP
\fIbin/tgt\fP 
the generic table editor.
.TP
\fIbin/psf\fP
a program to filter PostScript output.
.TP
\fIlib/banner.ps\fP
PostScript banner page that can be used when the printer
does not print a banner page.
.TP
\fIlib/help/*\fP
The help directory contains a collection of text files for
