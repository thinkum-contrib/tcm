10. Frequently Asked Questions
</H1>

<P>
Like most lists of frequently asked questions, this FAQ contains 
a compilation of questions and answers. The questions are
either asked in the past or we expect that many users might
want to ask these questions. For an overview and explanation of 
the TCM (environment) variables like <TT>$TCM_HOME</TT> please see 
section&nbsp;<A HREF="usersguidenode3.html#Installation">1.4</A> of this manual.

10.1 What is TCM?
</H1>

<P>
TCM stands for the Toolkit for Conceptual Modeling, made by
the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam and the University of Twente, The 
Netherlands. It is a suite of graphical editors that is intended 
to be used for software specifications. TCM is also found to be 
useful by its users for drawing generic diagrams or tables, especially
on the Linux platform.

<P>
The acronym TCM stands also for a number of other things
that have nothing to do with our TCM, such as
Trellis Coded Modulation (encryption theory),
The Computer Museum 
(<A NAME="tex2html190"
 HREF="http://www.tcm.org">www.tcm.org</A>),
Traditional Chinese Medicine and the Texas Chain-saw Massacre (a horror movie).

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION001220000000000000000">
10.2 Where can I get TCM?</A>
</H1>

<P>
TCM binaries, sources and documentation are uploaded to the 
site <A NAME="tex2html191"
 HREF="ftp://ftp.cs.utwente.nl/pub/tcm">ftp://ftp.cs.utwente.nl/pub/tcm</A>. This site is mirrored at

10.3 How do I install TCM?
</H1>

<P>
The installation instructions can be read in section&nbsp;<A HREF="usersguidenode3.html#Installation">1.4</A> of 
this manual. The INSTALL file in the distributions and the web 
page <A NAME="tex2html195"
 HREF="http://www.cs.utwente.nl/~tcm/software.html">www.cs.utwente.nl/~tcm/software.html</A>
contain installation
instructions too.

10.4 How do I start up TCM?
</H1>

<P>
You start TCM with the Unix command <TT>tcm</TT>, or you can start up 
individual editors like we have explained in
section&nbsp;<A HREF="usersguidenode3.html#Installation">1.4</A>. If starting up TCM does not succeed or 
when TCM starts up and crashes immediately then it is probably
one of the following problems:

<P>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>1.
<DD>You should set <TT>$TCM_HOME</TT> to the globally accessible 
TCM directory. Check also that the tools are accessible and 
in your <TT>PATH</TT> variable (check this for instance with 
the Unix command <TT>which</TT>). 
If not, add <TT>TCM_BIN</TT> to your <TT>PATH</TT> variable.
<P>
<DT>2.
<DD>Make sure that you run X Windows and that your <TT>DISPLAY</TT>
variable is set correctly (you can test this with 
<TT>echo $DISPLAY</TT>). Note also that when you run an X 
application remotely, your X display should be open for it. 
See the manual pages xhost(1) and xauth(1) for how you can 
safely open your X display for remote applications.

<P>
<DT>3.
<DD>Check the version of the operating system you are 
running, for instance with <TT>uname -a</TT>. 
Maybe you have installed a TCM distribution for a 
different OS. With the command <TT>file `which tcm`</TT> you 
can see what type of executables the distribution contains.

<P>
<DT>4.
<DD>If you cannot start TCM because of messages about libraries that
are not found or cannot be opened, e.g. ``libXm.so: can't open file'' 
then proceed with the answer of question&nbsp;<A HREF="usersguidenode12.html#LibBla">B.21</A>.

<P>
<DT>5.
<DD>If TCM immediately crashes with a message like
``X Error of failed request'' then proceed with the answer of
question&nbsp;<A HREF="usersguidenode12.html#DrawingOption">B.20</A>.

<P>
<DT>6.
<DD>If TCM does start up but it displays some dubious error messages
about failed assertions or implementation errors then proceed
with the answer of question&nbsp;<A HREF="usersguidenode12.html#AssertionFailed">B.39</A>.

<P>
<DT>7.
<DD>When you work under Linux, make sure that your system has
the glibc (also known as libc6) libraries version 2.1 installed. TCM does 
not work with the older libc5 libraries nor with glibc 2.0. Also the X 
libraries should have been compiled with glibc 2.1.

<P>
<DT>8.
<DD>If all this does not help, you can always send 
a description of your problems in an e-mail to the mailing list
<A NAME="tex2html196"
 HREF="mailto:tcm-users@cs.utwente.nl">tcm-users@cs.utwente.nl</A>.

10.5 Where can I find the user manual of TCM?
</H1>

<P>
All TCM distributions contain a copy of the user manual.
The file <BR> <TT>TCM_DOC/usersguide-&lt;version&gt;.ps.gz</TT>
is the user manual in gzipped PostScript format. An HTML version can
be read via <A NAME="tex2html197"
 HREF="index.html"><TT>TCM_DOC/usersguide/index.html</TT></A>
You can also download the user manual separately 
from our FTP-site <A NAME="tex2html198"
 HREF="ftp://ftp.cs.utwente.nl/pub/tcm">ftp://ftp.cs.utwente.nl/pub/tcm</A>. There you can find copies both
in gzipped PostScript as in PDF-format.

<P>

 HREF="http://www.cs.utwente.nl/~tcm/usersguide/index.html">www.cs.utwente.nl/~tcm/usersguide/index.html</A>

10.6 What else can I read about the methods supported in TCM?</A>
</H1>

<P>
If you want to know only a bit more about the methods supported 
in TCM, you can read the mini-tutorial in appendix&nbsp;<A HREF="usersguidenode11.html#MiniTut">A</A>.

<P>
Roel Wieringa has written a book&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="usersguidenode14.html#Wieringa96-01">22</A>] 
that treats a number of methods that are supported by TCM in more
depth (Entity-Relationship modeling, Structured Analysis and JSD).

<P>
From <A NAME="tex2html200"
 HREF="http://www.cs.utwente.nl/~roelw/RE1.ps">www.cs.utwente.nl/~roelw/RE1.ps</A>
you can download the 
table of contents of that book. 

<P>
The home page of Roel Wieringa, 
<A NAME="tex2html201"
 HREF="http://www.cs.utwente.nl/~roelw">www.cs.utwente.nl/~roelw</A>
contains links to a bibliography 
of his reports and articles and some of these can be downloaded in 
PostScript format.

<P>
When you look for the official UML documentation, take a look at
<A NAME="tex2html202"
 HREF="http://www.omg.org/uml">www.omg.org/uml</A>
on
the web-site of the Object Management Group. When you are new to 
conceptual modeling and you want to read a book that gives a 
brief introduction to UML, you can try&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="usersguidenode14.html#Fowler97">9</A>]. 
The Unified Modeling Reference Manual&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="usersguidenode14.html#Booch99">1</A>] is much more 
extensive however and is intended for people who are already familiar 
with some modeling method.

10.7 Is TCM available for my platform?
</H1>

<P>
In principle, TCM should be able to compile and run on all Unix 
systems that have X Windows and Motif. Before compiling or porting TCM
on your system, please read the 
<A NAME="tex2html203"
 HREF="../developersguide/index.html">developer's guide</A>&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="usersguidenode14.html#Dehne2000b">4</A>]
that can also be found as a PostScript and PDF document in the 
<TT>doc</TT> subdirectory of the TCM source code distribution.
For compiling the sources you need a C++ compiler (g++ is the best choice) 
and you need Motif, <A NAME="tex2html204"
 HREF="http://www.lesstif.org">LessTif</A>
or
<A NAME="tex2html205"
 HREF="http://www.opengroup.org/openmotif">Open Motif</A>
(preferred).

<P>
At the moment distributions have been made for Solaris 2.x 
(Sparc and x86), SunOS 4.x.x, Linux 2.0 (x86, ELF), IRIX 5.x (SGI), 
AIX 4.x (RS6000), HP-UX 10.x and OSF/1 (or Digital Unix) and
even on Windows, running the 
<A NAME="tex2html206"
 HREF="http://www.cygwin.com/xfree">CYGWIN/XFree86</A>
environment. TCM should run under FreeBSD and Darwin (Mac OS X) too. 
See the file <A NAME="tex2html207"
 HREF="ftp://ftp.cs.utwente.nl/pub/tcm/README">README</A>
or the web-page <A NAME="tex2html208"
 HREF="http://www.cs.utwente.nl/~tcm/software.html">www.cs.utwente.nl/~tcm/software.html</A>
for the distributions 
currently available. We try to keep the Solaris and Linux distributions and 
the source code distributions up-to-date but for the other platforms it 
is possible that only a somewhat older version exists. 

<P>

10.8 What to do if I don't have Motif?
</H1>

<P>
Most commercial Unix systems have the Motif library standardly included. 
However, Motif is often not included in older operating systems like 
SunOS or in free operating systems like Linux.
Therefore we have made different Linux and SunOS distributions of TCM. 
One has the Motif library statically linked in 
and the other has not. The distributions that contain a statically linked 
Motif library have the string <TT>-statmotif</TT> in their file names.
The distributions that dynamically link to the Motif library have
the string <TT>-dynmotif</TT> in their file names.

<P>
Motif itself is copyrighted so we are not allowed to put the Motif 
library itself (libXm.so) in the distributions.
<A NAME="tex2html209"
 HREF="http://www.rahul.net/kenton/faqs/mfaq_index.html">www.rahul.net/kenton/faqs/mfaq_index.html</A>
contains 
the Motif FAQ including where you can get Motif.
Instead of purchasing Motif, you can use the free Motif 
clone LessTif (<A NAME="tex2html210"
 HREF="http://www.lesstif.org">www.lesstif.org</A>)
or preferably Open Motif (<A NAME="tex2html211"
 HREF="http://www.opengroup.org/openmotif">www.opengroup.org/openmotif</A>).
We've experienced "flakiness" with TCM compiled with Lesstif, so please

10.10 How can I compile or port TCM for my system?
</H1>

<P>
It is not difficult to port TCM to some Unix, if it has a decent C++ 
compiler and it has X11 and the Motif library (see also question&nbsp;<A HREF="usersguidenode12.html#OS-TCM">B.7</A>.
Porting TCM merely consists of editing a configuration file (and
maybe one or two Makefiles) and possibly a handful of conditionally compiled 
source code lines has to be added or changed, because some Unix calls 
might be different or because the compiler is somewhat idiosyncratic.
Before compiling, please read the <A NAME="tex2html214"

10.12 In what programming language is TCM written?
</H1>

<P>
This version of TCM is written in C++ and developed under 
Solaris and Linux. In fact it is programmed in a subset of C++,
as C++ contains so many features that we don't need.
The same source tree has been compiled on Solaris with the Sun CC compiler 
(v. SC3.0.1 and SC4.2), on Solaris, Linux, OSF/1 and HP-UX
with the GNU g++ compiler (many versions of 2.7.2 and higher), on SunOS 
with the AT&amp;T C++ compiler (v. 3.0.1), on IRIX 5.x with the Delta C++ 
compiler and on AIX 4.x with the xlC C++ compiler.
<A NAME="9885">&#160;</A><A NAME="9886">&#160;</A><A NAME="9887">&#160;</A><A NAME="9888">&#160;</A><A NAME="9889">&#160;</A>
<A NAME="9890">&#160;</A>
With the Sun CC compiler and with the Delta C++ shared
object libraries were created. The other compilations are 
statically linked. The reason that with g++ no shared libraries
were created was because of the curious way that this compiler
treats C++ templates.
TCM uses the Xlib and Xt libraries (X11R5 or X11R6)
and it uses the Xm library of OSF/Motif (versions 1.2,
2.0 and 2.1 all work). However, when TCM is compiled
against with one version of Motif it can't be run with another version.
Check the file <A NAME="tex2html217"

10.14 Why is Motif used for the GUI?
</H1>

<P>
There are two widespread complaints about Motif. 
The first complaint is that it is expensive commercial software. 
The second complaint is that it is not suited for being used 
in object oriented programs written in C++&nbsp;<A NAME="tex2html221"
 HREF="#foot10105"><SUP>10.1</SUP></A>.

<P>
Our answer to the first complaint is that people do not have to 
buy Motif for working with TCM. On some systems, like Solaris, 
Motif is part of the standard software. On others, like Linux, Motif is not 
included. But we have made Motif libraries part of the TCM executables
for these systems. This is allowed by the Motif copyright.
Furthermore, the application environment specification of Motif is 
free and there exist a public domain Motif clone, called LessTif 
(<A NAME="tex2html222"
 HREF="http://www.lesstif.org">www.lesstif.org</A>).
You're advised to use Open Motif 
<A NAME="tex2html223"
 HREF="http://www.opengroup.org/openmotif">Open Motif</A>, 
see question&nbsp;<A HREF="usersguidenode12.html#Motif">B.8</A>.

<P>
Our answer to the second complaint, about C++ and Motif, is that in theory, 
it is true. But with the right discipline you can write object oriented 
programs in almost any programming language and without discipline you 
cannot write object oriented programs in C++ (as C++ is a hybrid between
an object oriented and a procedural programming language). 
Young&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="usersguidenode14.html#Young92">28</A>] gives a good introduction to Motif programming
in C++. What counts most is that the program is based on an object 
oriented specification and design and that a suitable mapping is found to the
programming language. We claim that this is the case for TCM:
It is based on an object oriented specification and design and
this design maps almost directly to the program which is a 
combination of C++ and Motif, whose interface happens to be 
a C library. TCM <I>could</I> also be written in another programming 
language. In fact, this is already happening, see question&nbsp;<A HREF="usersguidenode12.html#Billware">B.16</A>.

<P>
But why is Motif used and not some of the other GUI libraries that
are available? Motif gives us a lot of advantages. It is fast and 
very reliable. Motif is standardized and very well documented. There 
are a good learning and reference books for Motif such 
as&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="usersguidenode14.html#Young92">28</A>,<A
 HREF="usersguidenode14.html#Young94">29</A>,<A
 HREF="usersguidenode14.html#Brain92">2</A>,<A
 HREF="usersguidenode14.html#Oreilly6-91">10</A>]&nbsp;<A NAME="tex2html224"
 HREF="#foot10106"><SUP>10.2</SUP></A>.
The Motif interface is more or less standard in Unix systems, often
in form of the common desktop environment (CDE). There are also 
many standard and free Motif widgets. The user does not need much time to 
learn to work with a Motif GUI and the user does not need to 
install special software to be able to use it.

<P>
Of course we found also some disadvantages: it costs some time for a 
programmer to master Motif and there are certain things that 
have to be done in the underlying layers of Motif: Xt and Xlib,
which are more complicated from a programmer's point of view. 
Furthermore, Motif applications are compiled, not interpreted, which 
makes Motif not well suited for very rapid prototyping or 
programming by trial and error, like you can do in Perl, Python or
Tcl/Tk. This means that you have to know what you want to 
program in advance and to be prepared to spend some time to implement
a certain feature.

<P>

10.15 Did you use other tools or widget sets to build TCM?</A>
</H1>

<P>
Not extensively. TCM is almost entirely made with our bare hands 
using the standard Unix tools for programming.
But TCM itself proved to be a great tool for making the
design. For instance, TSSD was used for the class structures,
TFRT for the system decomposition and the source code organization 
and TGD was used to draw the structure of the widgets.
Furthermore, all diagrams and tables in the user manual and
the technical documentation are drawn with TCM.
For generating documentation from the source code we used
the great and simple to use package DOC++. DOC++ can be 
got from: <A NAME="tex2html225"
 HREF="http://www.zib.de/Visual/software/doc++/index.html">www.zib.de/Visual/software/doc++/index.html</A>.<A NAME="9920">&#160;</A>
For testing and debugging TCM, we made use of the program called purify
(<A NAME="tex2html226"
 HREF="http://www.rational.com/products/purify/index.html">www.rational.com/products/purify/index.html</A>). 
Purify instruments a program to detect run-time memory corruption errors 
and memory leaks. It is a very powerful and helpful tool.<A NAME="9923">&#160;</A>
The user interface of TCM is build with the Motif 1.2 widget set.
The bubble help texts that pop up in the user interface are 
implemented with the Lite Clue <A NAME="9924">&#160;</A>widget 
(<A NAME="tex2html227"
 HREF="http://www.compgen.com/widgets/index.html#ALiteClue">www.compgen.com/widgets/index.html#ALiteClue</A>).
For the representation of the diagrams and tables we did not use
any special widgets. The lowest level of drawing is done with
Xlib calls. The graph and its constituent parts are implemented
as C++ classes, all written by ourselves.

The TCM project had in the past a sister project called WHERE, which 
is performed at the NASA Software Research Laboratory
(see <A NAME="tex2html229"
 HREF="http://research.ivv.nasa.gov/projects/WHERE">research.ivv.nasa.gov/projects/WHERE</A>).
Part of this project was the translation of TCM into Java
<A NAME="9939">&#160;</A><A NAME="9940">&#160;</A> (see 
<A NAME="tex2html230"
 HREF="http://research.ivv.nasa.gov/projects/WHERE/TCMJava">research.ivv.nasa.gov/projects/WHERE/TCMJava</A>).
The software is in alpha stage, but many things work. Because it 
is written in Java, TCMJava runs on Solaris, Windows NT, Linux 
and probably also on others.

<P>
Via <A NAME="tex2html231"
 HREF="http://research.ivv.nasa.gov/projects/WHERE/TCMJava">research.ivv.nasa.gov/projects/WHERE/TCMJava</A>
you can download TcmJava. Note that for running TCMJava you should install
the Java Development Kit or the Java Runtime Environment, but on the above
mentioned web page it is explained what versions you need.

<P>
Our plan is to continue the development of our TCM
for X Windows and Unix systems written in C++. We don't have plans to port 
TCM to systems that do not have X Windows and Motif, for the simple reason 
that it will cost us too much time. A port of TCM to another GUI library is 
no quick or easy job. The X11/Motif part consists of over 10000 lines 
of source code which should be adapted or rewritten.

10.17 How can I configure TCM?

Some behavior of TCM can be tailored with configuration files.
<TT>TCM_CONFIG/tcm.conf</TT> is the system-wide configuration file. 
The options of this file may be overridden by a user's private 
configuration file in <TT>$HOME/.tcmrc</TT>.

<P>
The configuration files contain a number of attribute-value pairs separated 
by white space and enclosed by curly braces (basically it is the same as the 
TCM file format in appendix&nbsp;<A HREF="usersguidenode13.html#FileFormat">C</A>).
Comments in the file start with a hash (<TT>#</TT>). The text 
in the same line after the hash is ignored. The name of the attributes are 
case sensitive. In the file itself you find comment text which gives 
directions for what the attributes mean and what alternative attribute 
values are possible.

adapt it to your wishes. You can load it with <TT>xrdb -merge</TT> or copy 
it in the file <TT>.Xresources</TT> or in <TT>.Xdefaults</TT> in your home 
directory. When you use the <TT>xrdb</TT> command then it must be issued

10.19 Why does TCM sometimes show fewer or different colors?
</H1>

<P>
This is probably caused by other programs that already run and
which occupy too much entries in the X color map - leaving not enough
for TCM. You are probably running in 8-bit (256 color) mode, and
have other programs that use colors running on your display. 
Common culprits are background pictures or patterns, and 
Netscape, which is a notorious color hog.
You can best start up TCM first because it takes
only what it needs, and then start up Netscape and 
the other color eaters. Netscape can also be started with
the options <TT>-install</TT> for using a private color map
or with <TT>-ncols &lt;N&gt;</TT> to set the maximum number of colors
that it uses.
When TCM cannot find any colors (on a color display)
then it starts with a private color map. When you start TCM with 
the option <TT>-priv_cmap</TT>, it always uses a private color map.
If you want to use TCM by default with a private colormap you
can set the option <TT>PrivateColormap</TT> to <TT>True</TT> in the
file <TT>TCM_CONFIG/tcm.conf</TT> or in <TT>$HOME/.tcmrc</TT>.

10.20 Why does TCM crash with ``X Error of failed request''?
</H1>

<P>
When you get a message like <TT>X Error of failed request:
BadAlloc (insufficient resources for operation)</TT> etc.,
then this is probably caused by a lack of memory on your X server 
for the pixmap of the drawing area. The drawing area is
implemented as a large X color pixmap, which consumes a lot of memory.
The default pixmap is about 1300 by 1300 pixels. That is enough to
draw a document on one A3 or two A4 pages. You can create
a larger or smaller drawing area by starting the editor with the
command line option <TT>-drawing "width"x"height"</TT> or by changing
the initial drawing area size in View menu of the TCM start-up tool.
For instance, you can start TGD with <TT>tgd -drawing 800x600</TT> 
which gives a drawing area that is 800 pixels wide and 600 pixels high.
If you want to have this initial size permanently you can set the
options <TT>DrawingWidth</TT> and <TT>DrawingHeight</TT> in 
<TT>TCM_CONFIG/tcm.conf</TT> or <TT>$HOME/.tcmrc</TT>.

10.21 Why won't TCM start saying ``lib<I>BlaBla</I>.so: can't open file''?

<P>
This is due to to the fact that the system cannot find a shared
library needed by TCM. When you execute the command <TT>ldd `which tcm`</TT>,
you see against which libraries TCM is linked and where these are
found (if they are found) on your system.
The remedy to this problem depends on the kind of <I>BlaBla</I>. 
<UL>
<LI>If <I>BlaBla</I> is either libglobal.so, libgui.so, libeditor.so, 
libdiagram.so or libtable.so then TCM cannot find its own libraries. Check if they 
are installed in <TT>TCM_LIB</TT>. If they are, expand your 
<TT>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</TT> variable with the value of <TT>TCM_LIB</TT>.

<P>
<A NAME="10108">&#160;</A>

<P>
<LI>If <I>BlaBla</I> is libXm.so then TCM cannot find (the right version
of) the Motif library.
Check the version number of the Motif library. As it is impossible
to run with version 1.2 when it needs 2.0 and vice versa.
When you do not have Motif, you should obtain a distribution in which Motif is 
statically linked (see question&nbsp;<A HREF="usersguidenode12.html#Motif">B.8</A>).
If you have Motif, you could try to set the 
<TT>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</TT> to include the Motif library directory.

<P>
In the past, the Linux executables of TCM were stripped too rigorously 
so that a Motif library with a different minor revision number than the
one we used, could not be dynamically linked. Hopefully the current version 
of TCM has fixed this problem.

<P>
<LI>If <I>BlaBla</I> is libX11.so, libXt.so or something else with an X
in it, then TCM cannot find one of the X Windows libraries. 
Look where they actually are on your system. Install them in the expected 
directory, or append to your <TT>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</TT> the directory where 
they actually are.

<P>
<LI>If <I>BlaBla</I> is something else, like for instance libC.so.5 or
libg++.so.27  then some other Unix or C library cannot be found.
Either set your <TT>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</TT>, if they are at a different place
than expected or install them if that is possible.
</UL>
<P>
If you are still in big need, you can always try to ask us for help
or for the library that you need (provided that this is allowed) or maybe
it is possible to build a distribution in which that library is 
statically linked.

10.22 Why does TCM complain about old versions when I load a diagram?</A>
</H1> 

<P>
There are two possibilities.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>1.
<DD>The first most probable one is that your documents were indeed made
by a newer version of TCM. For instance, you or someone else might 
have made the document with a newer version of TCM, probably
at home or work. TCM editors are supposed to be upward compatible and
should read older file formats. As of TCM version 1.99 (file format 
version 1.30) the TCM editors also attempt to read in newer file formats 
than the one that they generate; 
incompatibilities will be shown in the message log dialog window.
They always generate 
one file format. In the entry Document Info in the Document menu you can see 
what file format the editor generates and what file format you have read.
The best solution is to upgrade TCM.
<DT>2.
<DD>A second possibility is that the file format was not written
correctly. This is a bug in the Linux version that was once reported.
The third line of the saved file should contain the file
format version, for instance <code>{ Format 1.2 }</code>. But instead 
some random number was written. 
Probably the cause is a buggy version of libg++.so and libstdc++.so.
At least, it has been reported to us that after an upgrade of 
/usr/lib/libg++.so.27.1.0 and /usr/lib/libstdc++.so.27.1.0 to
/usr/lib/libg++.so.27.2.1 respectively /usr/lib/libstdc++.so.27.2.1

10.23 How can I print my TCM documents?
</H1> 

<P>
Maybe you do not have to print at all and is it sufficient to 
use the Show Preview command.
If you have a PostScript printer, you can print 
your document directly with the Print command. 
If that does not work, check if the printer name is 
correctly set (Printer Name), and if the printer is 
on-line (Printer Queue). Otherwise try if you can save the
document to file as PostScript and try to send 
the PostScript file to the printer.

<P>
If you have a non-PostScript printer that is capable of 
printing graphics, write your document as plain PostScript 
to a file. You have to convert this PostScript file to 
a format that is suitable for your type of printer.
The Ghostscript interpreter/previewer, called as <TT>gs</TT>,
can help to do this. You can select different output 
devices, which include drivers for most current printers.
Do <TT>gs -h</TT> or <TT>man gs</TT> for more information.
You can find Ghostscript from any of the GNU 
distribution sites, such as <A NAME="tex2html232"

10.24 How can I include a TCM picture in my text document?
</H1>

<P>
If you work in a L<SUP><SMALL>A</SMALL></SUP>T<SMALL>E</SMALL>X environment or any other type setter or
word processor that accepts PostScript then you can save your
document a PostScript. It is best to save your document as encapsulated 
PostScript. Encapsulated PostScript documents use a bounding 
box<A NAME="10018">&#160;</A> which depends on the relative sizes inside 
the picture, not on the underlying page. This makes it possible to include it 
in an arbitrary place, scale it, rotate it etc.
The encapsulated PostScript file can be included in a L<SUP><SMALL>A</SMALL></SUP>T<SMALL>E</SMALL>X 
document by an extension package like <TT>graphicx</TT> (for L<SUP><SMALL>A</SMALL></SUP>T<SMALL>E</SMALL>X2<SUB>e</SUB>). 
With such a package it is probably possible to scale and rotate the 
included figure (see the package's documentation). All example diagrams 
and tables in this user manual were made with TCM and included as 
encapsulated PostScript with the graphicx package.
If you do not want to scale or rotate explicitly, make sure that the 
document in the TCM editor fits to one page. To fit you can move it to 
the first page with the Center button and scale it with the Whole 
Drawing command in the Scale menu.

<P>
For word processors that have no good PostScript support you can export
your document to PNG format. PNG is a format that is understood by most 
webbrowsers and by MS-Word. PNG is similar to the GIF-format but less 
controversial (see <A NAME="tex2html234"

leveled data flow diagrams&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="usersguidenode14.html#Dehne96c">6</A>].
Our plan is to make an editor in which you can edit 
an entire data flow model, in particular all diagram levels.

10.26 Are there plans for consistency checks across diagrams?
</H1>

<P>
Yes. The first step was implementing hierarchical diagram editors.
That means that for example the entire DFD hierarchy is edited as 
one document and the inter-DFD consistency checks are all performed 
locally just like it is done now. 
The next step will be support for more specific methods
(see question&nbsp;<A HREF="usersguidenode12.html#MethodSupport">B.28</A>).

10.27 Is it possible for the user to define its own symbols?</A>
</H1>

<P>
No. Within an editor the nodes, edges, shapes and the constraints
on them can not be reconfigured by the user.
It is however possible to program extensions and modifications
in the TCM source code.

10.28 Do you have any plans to support specific methods?

<P>
Yes. We want to support 
UML&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="usersguidenode14.html#UML1.1notation">17</A>,<A
 HREF="usersguidenode14.html#UML1.1semantics">18</A>] more extensively.
UML is object oriented. The UML support is for both educational
as research purposes.
Also, we want to give specific support for a structured method,
in particular for our own variant of the Yourdon Systems Method (YSM) 
(mainly for educational purposes). 

<P>
The toolkit support for UML and YSM as representative of the 
family of object oriented respectively structured methods includes 
building (and checking) models that are made from diagrams built 
by different editors.

10.29 Do you have plans for code generation?
</H1>

<P>
Yes and some others are already working on that. 
For instance, in a prototype someone generated SQL from
.esd files (ER-diagrams) and in another one XML is
generated from .std files (State-transition diagrams).
If you are interested, contact us or see our 'links' page.

<P>
It is not very hard to write your own program that generates 
specifications in whatever language from TCM files. The TCM 
file format simple, human-readable and it is specified in 
appendix&nbsp;<A HREF="usersguidenode13.html#FileFormat">C</A>.

10.30 Is it possible to drag and drop with TCM?
</H1>
No. There is no real drag and drop between editors even not
between the same type of editor.
Drag and drop between the same type of editor (see it as an 
extension of the cut-paste buffer) is put on our wish list.
But for the time being, if you want to move things from one editor 
to the other, you have to save it to file (with Save or Save selection)
and load it (with Load or Append) into the other editor.

10.31 What file formats does TCM generate?
</H1>

<P>
At the moment PostScript, EPSF, PNG, the Fig format and the TCM 
format are generated. TCM only reads its own format.
The Fig format can be read by the Xfig program and from this
program or by using the command <TT>fig2dev</TT> 
you can generate numerous other graphical file formats such 
as L<SUP><SMALL>A</SMALL></SUP>T<SMALL>E</SMALL>X, combined PostScript and L<SUP><SMALL>A</SMALL></SUP>T<SMALL>E</SMALL>X, PiCTeX, GIF, JPEG, 
XPM and many more.

<P>
The TCM file format is specified in appendix&nbsp;<A HREF="usersguidenode13.html#FileFormat">C</A>. 
If you take a look into a saved file, you will see that it is
human-readable. Furthermore, it reflects the structure 
of a repository for TCM models, consisting of
multiple documents. Each diagram file has four distinct parts: 
storage information, document information, the graph and 
the representation. Each table file has five distinct parts:
storage information, document information, overall table
information, the columns and the rows.
With a little bit of imagination one can see many possible 
programs interfacing with TCM via this file format.

10.32 I want to draw an XYZ diagram, which tool should I use?</A>
</H1>

<P>
In figure&nbsp;<A HREF="usersguidenode3.html#TCMMethods">1.1</A> there is a list in which you can see
which tool is intended for which notational technique. If you want to do 
something different: TCM contains a generic diagram editor, a generic 
table editor and a generic tree editor. In these editors almost
no constraints are built-in so it is easy to (ab)use them. 
The specific tools offer some other specific graphical features, 
though, but the constraints can be a hindrance if they are not 
applicable to your diagram technique. 
Alternatively, you can try to extend or build your own diagram
editor with the source code. See also question&nbsp;<A HREF="usersguidenode12.html#XYZDiagrams">B.33</A>.

10.33 Is it possible to make an editor for XYZ diagrams? 
</H1>

<P>
First of all you could probably use one of the already existing 
editors. Especially the generic diagram editor TGD is quite versatile.

<P>
If you have the sources and you wish to build a
specific editor yourself or extend an existing editor, then
it is not extremely difficult to do that, at least when the kind
of diagram that you want to edit can be described as a graph. 
Or, if the document has some kind of tabular format, then you 
can make a variant of the generic table editor. If you want to 
develop your own editor, based on TCM, you are advised 
to read the <A NAME="tex2html236"

10.34 How can I have more influence on the layout? 
</H1>

<P>
When you want to place your shapes were <I>you</I> want,
not where TCM thinks that you want, you could set
Point Snapping off and then you can move all the nodes, line 
handles and text labels exactly to the pixel where you want.
If you set the autoresize toggle off, you can resize the diagram
shapes and table rows and columns by hand. If you have 
difficulty to access a particular shape because it is too close 
to another shape, you can try to temporarily scaling it, making the drawing
larger.
But, when you use TCM a lot, you will inevitably find a 
situation in which an editor messes up your drawing. If that is the
case, please send us a bug-report.

10.35 How can I connect an edge with an edge? 
</H1>

<P>
When people draw a diagram by hand, you often see that nodes are
connected in a tree-like fashion. In general, this is not allowed
in a TCM editor. This is because most types of diagrams are graphs,
so each line should connect two node shapes; a line cannot connect 
to another line. 
In TGD it is possible to draw something that look like a ``fork'',
as you can connect in TGD a line (edge) with another line (edge).
As another option, if that is allowed in the diagram technique, 
you can use a small black dot or another small shape as the junction 
of the tree.
The tree editors have a special `forked tree' mode where the
branches are drawn as a fork. You can not edit the tree
in this mode, that is only possible in the `editable graph'
mode.

10.36 Why are there black pixels left in the drawing area?
</H1>

<P>
If you find the pixels droppings disturbing, do a refresh (&lt;Ctrl+V&gt;).
If you are not interested in technical details, skip the rest
of this question.

<P>
TCM draws in <I>exclusive or</I> (XOR) mode. 
In XOR mode, a new destination pixel is produced by the exclusive
or of the old destination pixel with the source pixel.
In this mode, you can easily draw and erase a figure. You draw a
figure to let it appear, and when you redraw it, you erase it. 
By sequencing drawing and redrawing you can simulating a shape being 
moved or dragged. Furthermore, in XOR mode, shapes can overlap each other
without damaging each other. The overlapping part is rendered white, and
when one of the shapes is moved or removed, it will be redrawn, so
the overlapping part will then appear black again.
For some reason a small rounding error can sometimes occur in drawing 
some kind of shape and that results in some remaining black pixels.
When you do a refresh, these pixels disappear.

<P>
A feature of TCM is that it maintains a second pixmap in the
background which contains a copy of the contents of the drawing
area (double buffering). It is used to copy back the contents into 
the drawing area quickly when the drawing area has been resized or
overlapped by other windows. Although this solution consumes a lot 
of memory, it makes drawing graphics relatively fast. A drawback is 
that pixel droppings may occur with some types of shapes.

10.37 Why doesn't the BackSpace key function correctly in Linux?

<P>
Applications that run under XFree (the X11 port for Linux),
seemed to have the problem that the BackSpace key acts like the Delete
key: they both delete the character after the cursor (they have the
same key code). You can assign them the right key codes in a file 
called <TT>.Xmodmap</TT> in your home directory. 
Add to that file the following two lines (and restart X):<A NAME="10067">&#160;</A>

10.39 What do these ``assertion failed:'' messages mean?
</H1>

<P>
It can happen that internal data structures such as the internal graph, a 
shape view or a table in the editor become inconsistent&nbsp;<A NAME="tex2html237"
 HREF="#foot10075"><SUP>10.3</SUP></A>. Therefore, we have built some assertions 
in the code. They are used for internal consistency checking or for checking if 
a command can be executed safely.
When these assertions fail, warning messages are added to the 
message log dialog and the message log dialog is displayed. The 
messages contain amongst others the source code file and line 
number where the assertion was checked and failed. This does not
say much to an ordinary user, who does not want to browse the source code,
But they can be very helpful for searching bugs. So when you send a bug 
report to us, you should include these assertion failed messages. 
Furthermore, as the diagram file is in plain text, you can also include a 
faulty document as plain text in your e-mail.
