2. Document Editing
</H1>

<P>
This chapter describes the features common to <I>all</I> the TCM editors. 
This includes most of the user interface components, loading documents, 
saving documents, printing documents and the on-line help.

<BR>
<P>
When you start up an editor, you will see the so-called main window.
For a screen dump of the main window see 
figure&nbsp;<A HREF="usersguidenode4.html#TCMMainWindow">2.1</A>. 

<P>
TCM needs in principle a 3-button mouse. The left and middle buttons are 
the most essential for drawing nodes and edges and the right button is 
only used for a pop-up menu. However, pressing or dragging with the left 
mouse button while you are pressing the Shift key has the same effect as 
pressing or dragging the middle button. This means that you can use TCM
as well with a 2-button mouse. Instead of button-2, you use Shift+button-1.
Another solution is to change the function of the right and middle mouse 
button with: <TT>xmodmap -e "pointer = 1 3 2"</TT>. If you're using a so-called 
5-button mouse (IntelliMouse with wheel-button),
you can change the function of the right and middle mouse button with:
<TT>xmodmap -e "pointer = 1 3 2 4 5"</TT>.
 
In this manual the mouse buttons are called from left to right: button-1,
button-2 and button-3 (or from right to left, if you have a 
special left-hand adjusted mouse). We almost never mention button-3 because 
button-3 is only used for popping up the Edit pop-up menu in the drawing 
area, whereas the same menu is also accessible via the menu bar.

<P>
Except the basic drawing commands in the drawing area, all parts 
of the user interface can be accessed by keystrokes as well as 
by mouse operations. This manual assumes that you are using 
the mouse as much as possible.

<P>

2.1.1 Tiled buttons.
</H2>
On the left edge of the main window of the diagram and tree editors
there are two sets of tiled buttons containing a bitmap symbol.
These contain two kinds of toggle buttons: radio buttons and check buttons.
<B>Radio buttons</B> are a set of mutually exclusive selection options.
The visual cue is a little diamond that is filled or unfilled. 
A <B>check button</B> is a non-mutually exclusive selection option. 
The visual cue is a little box that is filled or unfilled.
When you pass the mouse pointer over a tiled button for a second or two,
a one line bubble help clue is popped up giving the 
full name of what the tile represents.

<BR>
2.1.2 Menu bar.
</H2>
The menu bar located under the main window's title bar organizes most 
of the commands and features of the editors.
The menu bar works in a straightforward way: press button-1 
on an entry and keep it pressed down. A pull-down menu appears. Drag 
the mouse to the desired command and then release button-1. 
The menu is dismissed and the command is
executed. Some menus contain nested submenus, called <B>cascading menus</B>,
that work in a similar way.
You cancel a menu by moving somewhere outside the menu and then
releasing button-1.

<P>
Some frequently used commands can also be called directly, without going
through a menu, by means of a keystroke shortcut, called 
an <B>accelerator</B>.<A NAME="1455">&#160;</A><A NAME="1456">&#160;</A>
For example &lt;Ctrl+L&gt; is an accelerator for loading a document
from file. You can see in the text of the menu entries which 
commands have an accelerator.
Some menu entries contain check buttons that indicate
that a certain property of the editor is switched on or off.
If you select this entry, the value of the property will be inverted.
See for example the Show Page Boundary entry in the Page menu. 
Some other menu entries contain a submenu of radio buttons 
indicating that a certain editor property has a value 
that is one from a set of menu choices. Try for example the 
Page Size entry in the Page menu.

2.1.3 Drawing area.
</H2>
The drawing area, also called pane or canvas, is used
to create, edit and delete the graphical items of your document
by using the mouse. The mouse operations that are distinguished 
by TCM are summarized in figure&nbsp;<A HREF="usersguidenode4.html#MouseOperations">2.2</A>.<A NAME="1461">&#160;</A>

<P>
The whole drawing area is larger than the main window. You can use the
<B>scroll bars</B> on the right and bottom side of the drawing area to view the 
drawing area that requires more space than is available at any one time.
By resizing the main window you can resize the visible part of the drawing area, 
keeping the other parts of the main window the same size as 
much as possible.<A NAME="1470">&#160;</A>

<P>
TCM has its own coordinate system. By default, the TCM coordinates 
have the same distance as the coordinates of X Windows.<A NAME="1471">&#160;</A> 
The origin is in the top left corner of the drawing area. 
Like the X Window coordinates, the x-coordinates increase from left to 
right and the y-coordinates increase from the top down.
By scaling the ratio between the TCM and X Window coordinates 
can be updated.

it is on. If the toggle is on and you have loaded or created 
a new document, TCM warns you that the old document will 
be lost, and you get the opportunity to save the old document first.

2.1.10 Autoresizing.
</H2>
This is visible as a toggle beneath the
status area. When it is on, the shapes in the diagram or the cells
in the table are automatically resized to make it fit the text 
that they contain (see section&nbsp;<A HREF="usersguidenode4.html#EditingDocuments">2.5</A>).
When it is off, you should resize the shapes and cells manually
to make them the right size.

2.1.12 Hierarchic document.
</H2>
This is visible as a toggle beneath the status area, next to the In-line editor toggle.
When it is on, the current document is hierarchic,
i.e., nodes in this document can be hierarchically related.
This toggle is only relevant for hierarchic editors
(most diagram editors allow hierarchic documents).

2.1.13 Arrow Buttons.
</H2>
In the bottom-left corner of the main window
there are four arrow shaped buttons by which you can move the
entire document over the drawing area. Amidst these four buttons there
is a button labeled <TT>C</TT>, by which you can center the drawing
on the first page in the drawing area, at least when the drawing 
is not larger than a single page. When the drawing is larger than
one page, the drawing will be centered on the set of pages 
that the drawing occupies.

2.2 Changing the Document Name
</H1>

<P>
You can type in a new name in the document name text field above the 
drawing area. When you enter &lt;Return&gt;, the document name is changed. 
TCM checks whether the name has a valid suffix<A NAME="1510">&#160;</A> 
for the current type of document. See figure&nbsp;<A HREF="usersguidenode4.html#DocumentTypes">2.3</A> 
for the required suffixes. Furthermore, the document name should contain
only non-white space printable characters and it should not contain
the characters <code>{</code>, <code>}</code> or <code>/</code>.

<P>
When a document is loaded, the document name field is set to the
name of that document. If a new document is created, either by starting
the editor without a file name or by issuing the New command,
the newly created document will receive the default 
name <TT>untitled</TT>.

2.3 Changing the Project Directory
</H1>

<P>
You can change the project (working) directory with the
<B>Project Directory</B> entry<A NAME="1518">&#160;</A> in the File menu 
of the TCM startup window (see figure&nbsp;<A HREF="usersguidenode3.html#StartupWindow">1.2</A>).
You can also change the project (working) directory by editing the 
directory text field at the bottom of the main window. You can change it
by editing it and entering &lt;Return&gt;. TCM checks if the 
directory exists and if it is accessible.
This directory is intended for storing the files related to
the current (sub)project that you are working on. 
It is used as the starting directory for the file 
selection dialogs for loading and saving documents.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00440000000000000000">
2.4 Loading and Saving Documents</A>
</H1>

<P>
You can instantly start a TCM editor with a specific document 
via the <B>Open Document</B> entry<A NAME="1522">&#160;</A> in the File menu 
of the TCM startup window (see figure&nbsp;<A HREF="usersguidenode3.html#StartupWindow">1.2</A>).
The <B>Open Document</B> dialog is simular to the <B>Load Document</B>
dialog described below.
Selecting a TCM document will result in starting the TCM editor
associated with the document extension. For example selecting a <B>.ucd</B> 
document will launch the <B>TUCD</B> (Use Case Diagram) Editor with the
designated document loaded.

Where <I>xxx</I> is the suffix for the specific editor
(figure&nbsp;<A HREF="usersguidenode4.html#DocumentTypes">2.3</A>).
You can change the name of the new document in the document 
name text field.
Before the new document is created, the current document 
that was being edited is deleted from the editor.
If your current document is modified, TCM asks you if you want to save 
the document. 
Unless you have saved this document, the old document 
cannot be restored.

<P>
<LI><B>Load (</B>&lt;<B>Ctrl+L</B>&gt;<B>).</B><A NAME="1545">&#160;</A><A NAME="1546">&#160;</A>
Pops up a file selection dialog to
select the external file name for loading a document from file 
(figure&nbsp;<A HREF="usersguidenode4.html#LoadExample">2.4</A>). Before the document is loaded,
the current document that was being edited is deleted
from the editor.

Pops up a file selection dialog to
select the external file name for merging the current document
with another one from a file.

<P>
Diagrams that are appended, can be positioned at an 
arbitrary place in the drawing area by means of a paste box,
that works like the Paste command from the Edit menu 
(see section&nbsp;<A HREF="usersguidenode5.html#PasteSubjects">3.9</A>). Because appending is 
implemented as a Paste command, appending a document can 
be undone with Undo or be repeated by issuing the Paste 
command again.

<P>
Tables can be appended either below or to the right of 
the current table. This is determined by an option menu
in the append table file selection dialog.
In both cases, the original table stays the same but 
new rows are added to the bottom and/or new columns are 
added to the right of the table. Append table has an Undo too.

<P>
<LI><B>Save.</B> Saves the document<A NAME="1554">&#160;</A>
to an external file. If the document name is still <TT>untitled</TT>,
a file selection dialog pops up, like Save As. Otherwise the 
document is immediately saved in the file 
<I>document-name</I>.<I>suffix</I> in the project directory. 
When you attempt to overwrite an existing file, TCM gives 
a warning and you can cancel your action.

<P>
<LI><B>Save As (</B>&lt;<B>Ctrl+S</B>&gt;<B>).</B> Pops up a file selection 
dialog<A NAME="1559">&#160;</A><A NAME="1560">&#160;</A> to select or 
type in the file name to save 
the document to. After clicking <TT>OK</TT>, it acts the same as Save.

<P>
<LI><B>Save Selection As.</B> Pops up a file selection 
dialog<A NAME="1563">&#160;</A><A NAME="1564">&#160;</A> to select or 
type in the file name to save the selected part of the document to.
In diagram editors the selected shapes and the corresponding part of 
the graph is saved to file. In table editors the rows and columns that 
contain one or more selected cells are saved.

<P>
<LI><B>Quit (</B>&lt;<B>Ctrl+Q</B>&gt;<B>).</B> Quits TCM. If your current<A NAME="1566">&#160;</A>
document is modified, TCM asks you if you want to save 
the document. Of course, you can also quit the editor
by sending it a kill signal or by deleting the main window.
</UL>
<P>
The file selection dialog (figure&nbsp;<A HREF="usersguidenode4.html#LoadExample">2.4</A>) allows you<A NAME="1569">&#160;</A>
to select a file in the right side listing or to navigate 
through the file system by selecting a directory, including the parent 
directory (<code>..</code>), in the left side listing.
You can select a file or directory by either: 1. quickly double clicking 
on an entry, 2. single clicking on an entry and clicking <TT>OK</TT> or
3. filling in the field labeled <TT>Selection</TT> and clicking <TT>OK</TT>. 
The <TT>Filter</TT> field on top determines which file names are displayed. 
You can edit the filter setting, which takes effect after clicking the 
<TT>Filter</TT> button.

<P>
When you change directory in the load or save to file
dialog then the directory field in the main window
is updated to that directory
after that you dismissed the dialog. So with the load or save
to file dialog you can browse through the file system and the latest
visited directory is always remembered in the directory text field.
The export dialog from the Print menu also remembers its
last visited directory but independently from the directory 
from the load or save to file dialog.

2.5 Editing Documents
</H1>

<P>
There are two types of document edit commands: commands that are 
issued by the mouse, when the mouse pointer is in the drawing area, and the
commands listed in the Edit menu. All diagram and tree editors 
share the same set of edit commands (chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="usersguidenode5.html#DiagramEditing">3</A>).
All table editors share the same set of edit commands too
(chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="usersguidenode9.html#TableEditing">7</A>). However, the edit commands of diagram 
and tree editors on one hand and table editors differ to a large extent.

<P>
All document edit commands, except the simple selection commands and 
the key-stroke text edit commands are undo-able and redo-able (multiple levels).
All editors have certain commands to select items, to move and 
resize items, to edit the text of items, to add items and to 
delete items. Only the text edit commands are very similar across
all editors and therefore they are described in this chapter. 
For the other commands you are referred to chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="usersguidenode5.html#DiagramEditing">3</A> 
(diagrams and trees) and chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="usersguidenode9.html#TableEditing">7</A> (tables).

2.5.1 Editing Text in a Document
</H2>

<P>
In order to be able to type in a label of a shape in a diagram or
the text in a table cell, the shape or cell should be the <I>only</I> currently
selected shape or cell. For going into edit mode you can do the following.
Move the mouse pointer into the single selected shape or cell,
and when the mouse pointer has turned into a&nbsp;

 SRC="usersguideimg10.gif"
 ALT="\epsfig{figure=p/ibeamP.ps}">,
you can start editing by typing characters or by clicking button-1 again.
In both cases the edit mode starts.

<P>
There are two edit modes: in-line editing and out-line editing.<A NAME="1588">&#160;</A><A NAME="1589">&#160;</A><A NAME="1590">&#160;</A><A NAME="1591">&#160;</A>
<B>In-line editing</B> takes place directly in the drawing area and during in-line
editing a black triangle shaped cursor is visible. <B>Out-line editing</B> takes place in 
a separate window with a text editor that is popped up when the edit mode 
is entered. That window contains an editable Motif text entry area, 
a menu bar, scroll bars and two buttons: <TT>OK</TT> and <TT>Cancel</TT>.
You can indicate which of the two possible edit modes has to be used
by a toggle button labeled <TT>in-line editor</TT>. That toggle is near 
the bottom of the main window and it is also accessible via the View menu. 
In general, in-line editing is more suitable for quickly editing 
short labels, whereas out-line editing has scroll bars and some extra
edit operations and is more suitable for editing large chunks of texts.
With out-line editing it is also possible to cut and paste text 
within and between text edit windows.

<P>

<P>
Here we summarize all operations that are available in the 
in-line editor.

<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Start editing.</B><A NAME="1600">&#160;</A>
Go into edit mode as explained above. When a triangle shaped
black cursor is displayed in the drawing area, you are in the 
in-line editor.

<P>
<LI><B>Stop editing.</B><A NAME="1602">&#160;</A>
From the in-line editor you leave edit mode by clicking button-1 outside
the shape or cell that is being edited or by clicking button-2 at any position
of the drawing area. The text that is edited will be updated, and when 
the autoresize toggle is on, the shape or cell will be resized 
to make it fit the text that it contains. After the text is updated, you can 
still undo the update including the autoresize, by issuing the undo command 
from the Edit menu. Text editing operations are not undo-able commands
but stop editing (from both the in-line as the out-line editor) is
an undo-able command.

<P>
When you issue another edit command (with the mouse or 
from the Edit menu) while you are in in-line edit mode, edit mode is 
aborted, the text is updated and the new edit command is executed.

<P>
<LI><B>Add character after the cursor.</B><A NAME="1604">&#160;</A>
Type in the character.  Labels may contain all printable ASCII characters,

2.5.3 The Text Edit Dialog
</H2>
Text edit dialogs are almost complete text editors, see figure&nbsp;<A HREF="usersguidenode4.html#TextEditDialog">2.5</A>. 
Text edit dialogs are not only used for out-line editing text labels
but also for editing document and subject annotations. The operations in 
the dialog are 
mostly standard Motif operations. Here we will summarize the most important
ones:

A blinking I-beam insertion cursor indicates where text will be inserted.

<P>
<LI><B>Stop editing.</B> You leave the edit session by clicking<A NAME="1639">&#160;</A>
the <TT>OK</TT> button. The dialog is dismissed and the text (a shape label, 
an annotation, a cell text etc.) will be updated. 
When the autoresize toggle is on, the shape or cell will 
also be resized to make it fit the entire text.
When the text editor is used for out-line editing, you can undo the

If you want to change the cursor position without changing the
selection, press &lt;Ctrl&gt; while you click button-1.

<P>
<LI><B>Select text.</B><A NAME="1667">&#160;</A>
You can select a part of the text by dragging with button-1 over the 
region that you want to select; or when you click button-1 twice in a word 
then the word is selected; or when you click thrice, the line is 
selected; or when you click four times, the entire text

Copy the selected text into the Motif <B>clipboard</B>.<A NAME="1672">&#160;</A>
Motif has a clipboard built-in which acts like a 
cut-paste buffer for copying and moving text between text areas 
of the same or different Motif applications.

<P>
<LI><B>Cut (</B>&lt;<B>Ctrl+X</B>&gt;<B>).</B><A NAME="1674">&#160;</A>

<LI><B>Find (</B>&lt;<B>Ctrl+F</B>&gt;<B>).</B><A NAME="1678">&#160;</A><A NAME="1679">&#160;</A>
This command pops up a prompt dialog (figure&nbsp;<A HREF="usersguidenode4.html#FindDialog">2.6</A>) for finding a text string
in the text edit area. The find text dialog has an input field to type
the text that you are looking for and it has a check button and four push
buttons that mean the following:
<UL>
<LI><B>case sensitive</B>. This check button says that the case of the string to<A NAME="1683">&#160;</A>
find is significant. By default, Find (and Replace) are case insensitive.
<LI><B>Find Next</B>. Finds the next string that matches the string to find.<A NAME="1685">&#160;</A>
The insertion cursor of the edit area is put in front of the string that 
is found and the scroll bars are adjusted if needed.<A NAME="1686">&#160;</A>
<LI><B>Find All</B>. Highlights all strings that matches the string 
to find and the dialog says how many occurrences are found.
<LI><B>Dismiss</B>. Closes the dialog.
<LI><B>Clear</B>. Clears the text entry field for the string to find.
</UL>
<P>
<LI><B>Replace (</B>&lt;<B>Ctrl+Z</B>&gt;<B>).</B><A NAME="1692">&#160;</A>
This command pops up a prompt dialog (figure&nbsp;<A HREF="usersguidenode4.html#ReplaceDialog">2.7</A>) for finding 
and replacing text strings
in the text edit area. The replace text dialog has two input fields, one to type
the text that you are looking for and one to type the text that you want as
a replacement. The replace dialog has a check button and five push
buttons that mean the following:
<UL>
<LI><B>case sensitive</B>. Same as in the Find dialog.
<LI><B>Find Next</B>. Same as in the Find dialog.<A NAME="1697">&#160;</A>
<LI><B>Replace Next</B>. The next string found after the insertion cursor is
replaced by the string to replace with. Before you do a Replace Next, 
you can do a Find Next so that you see which string you replace.
Also note that the string to find should not be empty, but the 
replacement string may be empty.<A NAME="1699">&#160;</A>
<LI><B>Replace All</B>. All strings that match the string to find are replaced
by the string to replace with (global substitution).
<LI><B>Dismiss</B>. Closes the dialog.
<LI><B>Clear</B>. Clears both text entry fields.
</UL>In the diagram and table editors the find dialog and the replace dialog
are also used for finding and replacing text in the entire diagram
or table. These operations are issued from the Find and Replace entries
in the Search menu of the main window (see section&nbsp;<A HREF="usersguidenode4.html#SearchMenu">2.11</A>).

<P>
<LI><B>Load (</B>&lt;<B>Ctrl+L</B>&gt;<B>).</B><A NAME="1706">&#160;</A>
This command shows a file selection dialog by means of which you 
can select an arbitrary text file. When you press <TT>OK</TT>, the contents 
of the file is loaded into the text editor. You can load any text 
file of any size.

<P>
<LI><B>Save as (</B>&lt;<B>Ctrl+S</B>&gt;<B>).</B><A NAME="1709">&#160;</A>
This command shows a file selection dialog for saving the contents of
the text editor to a file.

<P>
<LI><B>Print (</B>&lt;<B>Ctrl+P</B>&gt;<B>).</B><A NAME="1711">&#160;</A>
This command directly sends the contents of the text editor to
the current printer. The text is first converted to PostScript and it 
receives a header. At the moment it is only possible to directly 
print text with the Print of this dialog in Helvetica font and 
with point size 9. If you want the text printed differently, you 
have to save it first to a file and then post-process it yourself for
instance with the program <TT>text2ps</TT> that is supplied together
with TCM (see <TT>man text2ps</TT>).

<B>how</B> a document is viewed or how it can 
be edited in the document itself. View commands do not actually 
change something in the document. The Scale operations are in 
a separate menu but these are view commands too (as opposed to edit

View menu entries, but all editors share at least the following View 
menu commands:

<P>
<UL>
<LI><A NAME="1733">&#160;</A>
The <B>Refresh</B> command (&lt;Ctrl+V&gt;) is the first entry in 
the View menu. It redraws the contents of the drawing area. This 
command can be needed when pixel droppings or left-overs occur in
the drawing area.

<P>
<LI><A NAME="1736">&#160;</A> 
The <B>Grid</B><A NAME="1738">&#160;</A> facilitates the alignment of the 
shapes in the drawing
area. Only the diagram and tree editors have the Grid menu because 
tables are aligned in a different way. The grid cannot be printed. 
The options of the Grid menu are settings of the editor and
therefore they are not saved to file when a document is saved.
The Grid menu contains the following entries:<A NAME="1739">&#160;</A>

<P>
<UL>
<LI><A NAME="1741">&#160;</A>
<B>Show Grid</B>. Draw or hide the grid in the drawing area.

lines at an equal distance. This distance is called the <B>grid size</B>.

<P>
<LI><A NAME="1744">&#160;</A>
<B>Grid Size</B>. Set the size of the grid with a pop-up slider 
dialog. The default grid size is 30 pixels.

<P>
<LI><A NAME="1749">&#160;</A>
<B>Point Distance</B>. Set the point distance with a pop-up slider
dialog. The default is 10 pixels. The point distance is used when
point snapping is on. The grid size and the point distance 
are independent from each other.

<P>
The page layout determines how a document is sent to the
printer or saved as PostScript. See section&nbsp;<A HREF="usersguidenode4.html#PageLayout">2.9</A>
for the commands which determine the page layout. When a
document is printed or saved as PostScript, each page that
contains a part of the drawing is printed or saved.

<UL>
<LI><A NAME="1762">&#160;</A>
<B>Print (&lt;Ctrl+P&gt;).</B> You can send the drawing directly to
a PostScript printer with this command. When you have a printer 
that can not print PostScript, this command will print a PostScript listing.
See the frequently asked questions for how to get a more valuable 
result.

<P>
The default printer is the printer name in the 
TCM configuration file <TT>$HOME/.tcmrc</TT> or <BR> 
<TT>TCM_CONFIG/tcm.conf</TT>, whereby the options in the first
configuration file is user-specific and overrides the options in
the latter, system wide, configuration file.
When this variable is not set, the printer will be set to
the value of the <TT>PRINTER</TT> environment variable.

<P>
In the Printer Properties submenu you can see and modify
the printer settings that are used and in the Page menu you can change the
page layout. In general, the drawing is printed exactly as it is displayed in
the drawing area. For seeing what is exactly sent to the printer
you can issue the Show Preview command from the same menu.

<B>Export (&lt;Ctrl+E&gt;)</B>. 
This pops up a file selection dialog for saving the picture
to some graphics format. Currently, you can save 
as plain PostScript (PS; the same as what is sent directly to 
the printer), as Encapsulated PostScript (EPSF; a format that is more
 suitable than plain PostScript for including drawings into L<SUP><SMALL>A</SMALL></SUP>T<SMALL>E</SMALL>X or 
Troff documents), as Fig (either with PS fonts or with L<SUP><SMALL>A</SMALL></SUP>T<SMALL>E</SMALL>X fonts),
or as Portable Network Graphics (PNG), which was created in response to 
the GIF licensing debacle and is optimized for graphics use on the 
Internet and other on-line services. PNG is even supported by MS-Word,
so you can incorporate your TCM output in MS-Word too if you want to.

<P>
In the dialog there is an option menu called ``Format for Exported
 document'', in which you can set the intended output format.
In the dialog box a default export file name is 
already filled in. This is the document name with suffix <TT>.ps</TT>,
<TT>.eps</TT> or <TT>.fig</TT>. If you attempt to overwrite an existing file,
it pops up a dialog from which you can cancel the operation.
Furthermore, when you have dismissed the dialog, the last 
visited directory in this dialog is remembered as well as the 
last chosen output format in the option menu.

<P>
The Fig format is the file format that is read and written by

<B>Show Preview</B>. Starts up an external PostScript viewer, 
for previewing the document as it would be printed.
Hopefully this command saves some trees. 
You can use your preferred external PostScript viewer program 
<TT>ghostview</TT>, <TT>gv</TT> or <TT>pageview</TT>. You can specify
which viewer is used in the configuration file <TT>$HOME/.tcmrc</TT> 
(user specific) or in <TT>TCM_CONFIG/tcm.conf</TT> (system-wide).
Also, you can set another PostScript viewer in the 
<TT>Preview Command</TT> dialog window, from the Printer Options 
submenu.

<LI><A NAME="1786">&#160;</A>
<B>Printer Queue</B>. Use this option to see the printer queue 
of the current printer in a pop-up window. By clicking on a line
in the queue you select a print job. The <TT>Remove</TT> button tries to 
remove the selected job from the queue. <TT>Update</TT> redisplays the 
current queue. <TT>Dismiss</TT> removes the window. TCM uses external 
Unix programs for the printer queue. If it cannot find the right programs, 
it warns that the queue cannot be viewed or that jobs cannot be removed.
The external Unix programs that are used can be changed temporarily 
in the Printer Options submenu or more permanently in the TCM configuration 
files <TT>TCM_CONFIG/tcm.conf</TT> (system-wide) or <TT>$HOME/.tcmrc</TT> 
(user specific).

<P>
<LI><A NAME="1793">&#160;</A>
<B>Printer Properties</B>. This is a menu that contains entries

the user-specific file <TT>$HOME/.tcmrc</TT> (if it exists) and from the 
system-wide files <TT>TCM_CONFIG/tcm.conf</TT> and 
<TT>TCM_CONFIG/tcm.conf</TT>. <TT>.tcmrc</TT> has a higher precedence 
than <TT>tcm.conf</TT>.

<P>
In the Printer Properties menu these values can be changed 
temporarily i.e. only during the lifetime of the editor. If you want 
to save the changed options, you have to edit some TCM configuration 
file. The TCM configuration file is only read when an editor is started.

<P>
<UL>
<LI><A NAME="1801">&#160;</A>
<B>Printer Name</B>. Use this to change the printer name.
The default printer is the value of the <TT>PRINTER</TT> environment variable.
When <TT>PRINTER</TT> is not set, the value found in a TCM configuration 
file is used instead.

<P>
<LI><A NAME="1805">&#160;</A>
<B>Number of Copies</B>. Use this to change the number of copies that
will be printed. The default is 1. Change the setting by moving the little

the option <TT>PreviewCommand</TT>. That is some Unix 
command like <code>"/usr/X11/bin/ghostview"</code>, but an other 
PostScript viewers such as pageview or xpsview should work as 
well.

<P>
<LI><A NAME="1816">&#160;</A>
<B>Print Colors</B>. Specifies whether colors are printed or
saved in PostScript or not. When it is off, colors become 
gray-scales.

<B>Print Duplex Pages</B>.
Causes the output to be printed in duplex mode, i.e. pages are
printed two-sided if the printer supports that. The binding is 
as if the resultant pages are to be bound together with their leftmost edge.

<P>
<LI><A NAME="1820">&#160;</A>

only user of this printer, or you just want to save some trees.

<P>
<LI><A NAME="1829">&#160;</A>
<B>Print TCM Banner Page</B>.
An (extra) PostScript banner page will be printed in front of the printed
document. The banner page contains the document name, the current date and 
the login name of the user. This is useful when the printer does 
not print banners or when you think that this banner is cool.

The <B>scale percentage</B> is the<A NAME="1861">&#160;</A>
ratio between the TCM coordinates and the X Window coordinates,

2.9 The Page Layout
</H1>
The Page menu commands determine the page layout.
Any change in page layout is directly made visible in the drawing 
area. TCM is WYSIWYP, i.e. What You See Is What You Print.
The page layout has effect when plain PostScript is generated 
either when the document is printed, previewed or 
exported as plain PostScript. The Page menu commands have no effect
on the document when saved as Encapsulated PostScript, as this
format is independent from the page layout by definition.
The Page menu<A NAME="1865">&#160;</A> contains the following entries:

<P>
<UL>
<P>
<LI><A NAME="1867">&#160;</A><A NAME="1868">&#160;</A>
<B>Show Page Boundary</B>. Draw or hide the page boundary.
The positions of the boundaries are determined by the page 
size and the page orientation.

<P>
<LI><A NAME="1870">&#160;</A><A NAME="1871">&#160;</A><A NAME="1872">&#160;</A>
<B>Page Orientation</B>. Sets the page orientation
to Portrait (default) or Landscape. When the page boundaries
are shown, you see that the boundaries are repositioned. 
This affects the orientation in which the document is printed 
or saved as plain PostScript.

<P>
<LI><A NAME="1874">&#160;</A>
<B>Page Size</B>. Sets the page size. The current available
sizes are A4 (default, 210x297 mm.), A3 (297x420 mm.), 
Letter (8.5x11 inches), Legal (8.5x14 inches) and 
Executive (7.5x10 inches). The default 
page size can be changed in the TCM configuration file.

<P>
<LI><A NAME="1876">&#160;</A>
<B>Include Page Numbers</B>.
This is an option in the Page menu to show page numbers. Page 
numbers will be shown and printed when that option is on. Page numbers are
normally displayed at the bottom of the page, but when the
document info is displayed as a footer, page numbers are displayed 
at the top of the page.
<LI><A NAME="1878">&#160;</A><A NAME="1879">&#160;</A>
<B>Include Document Info</B>. 
This is a toggle menu which makes it possible to show information
about the document in the drawing area and on paper, because this 
information will be saved as plain PostScript too. This information 
can be added as a header, as a footer or both as a header and a footer.
The information consists of the
document name and type, the creation date and time, the author, 
the current tool, the current user and the current date and time. 
By issuing the refresh command or by generating PostScript
the information is updated (including the time strings).
As an aside, the user cannot alter this information in the editor, 
except the document name.
</UL>
<P>
The page orientation, the page numbering and the inclusion
of document info are saved in a document file. However, the
page size and boundary are are options of the editor not of 
the edited document. So when you save a document
the latter options are not saved.

The font families include Helvetica (default), Times, Courier, New Century

12, 14, 18 and 24. 
When you use Adobe fonts then the X fonts and the corresponding PostScript fonts 
look the same.
The fonts of the PostScript output contain the ISO Latin-1 character set.

TCM uses scalable X fonts by default (you see that when you use the Scale

then you can tell TCM to work with unscalable fonts by specifying:
<PRE>
       { ScalableFonts False }.

generates. The tools are supposed to read all file format versions
less than or equal to that version. When TCM encounters a never file 
format version it will attempt to read it in, but success is not
guaranteed. You better upgrade to a newer version then.
<LI>The Unix login name of the user running this editor.
<LI>The current date and time.
<LI>The project (working) directory.
<LI>How many changes (in terms of how many edit operations) 
were made to the current document after it was created or read in.
</UL>It shows the following information about the document being edited:
<UL>
<LI>Document type.
<LI>Document name.
<LI>Unix login name of the author. 
This is the login of the user that created the document.
<LI>Date and time of creation.
</UL>If the document was read from a file, it also shows:
<UL>
<LI>Unix file name from which the document was loaded.
<LI>The file format version found in that file.
<LI>Tool that wrote the file.
<LI>Date and time when the file was written by the tool.
</UL>Except the current document name, none of these values can be changed
from within the tool. Note that by default the name of the document 
is equal to the file name when it is saved. When a document
file is loaded and it contains a document name that is different 
from the file name (because the file had been renamed), 
a question dialog is raised which gives the user the choice
between these two names for the new document name.

<P>
<LI><B>Document Source</B>.<A NAME="2023">&#160;</A>
Pops up a text view dialog that contains the source 
of the document file as being loaded last time from disk.

<P>
All text editor options as described earlier are available here.
Advanced users of TCM may hack the file directly if they want to,
but do not expect intelligible feedback if you make a mistake.
For making the changes take effect, save the contents
of the dialog back to file and then (re)load the document via
the File menu.

<P>
Please take a look at appendix&nbsp;<A HREF="usersguidenode13.html#FileFormat">C</A> for a detailed 
specification and explanation of the TCM file format. 

<P>
<LI><A NAME="2025">&#160;</A><A NAME="2026">&#160;</A>
<B>Document Annotation</B>. Pops up a text edit dialog for giving
the document an annotation. This is free text and can for example
contain the description or purpose of the document, the history 
of the document or references to other documents. The annotation text 
can be loaded from an ASCII file, saved to an ASCII file and printed 
(as Postscript). Furthermore, it is possible to Cut or Copy (a part
of) the text to the Motif clipboard and it is possible to paste the
text from the clipboard in another text edit window. So for example,
when you want to add annotation text as a comment to a diagram, you can 
select the text by dragging with mouse button-1 (the selected text
is shown in reverse video) and copy the text from the annotation 
text edit dialog to the clipboard. Then you open the out-line editor of 
the comment node (the in-line editor toggle should be off),
and you choose Paste from the Edit menu of the out-line editor,
the text is pasted from the clipboard into that window. 
When you press the <TT>OK</TT> button of the out-line editor,
the text appears as a comment node.

<P>
<LI><A NAME="2029">&#160;</A>
<B>Check Document Syntax</B>. Shows the result of the checks for
soft constraints (constraints that can be temporarily 
violated) in a text view dialog. You should correct the errors yourself.
The checks are specific for the document type involved, so check
out the section in this manual where that type of document is 
explained. For an example of the result of checking an
erroneous data flow diagram see figure&nbsp;<A HREF="usersguidenode4.html#CheckDocumentDialog">2.14</A>.

The <B>Hierarchic Document</B> toggle. 
Turns Hierarchic Document on or off. Hierarchic Document means that 
nodes in this document can be hierarchically related.
This toggle is only relevant for hierarchic editors
(most diagram editors allow hierarchic documents).
It also (re)sets its counterpart toggle in the main window.

<P>
Both Document Info as Check Document use a 
<B>text view dialog</B><A NAME="2043">&#160;</A>
which resembles a text edit dialog except that the text is 
read-only. So you cannot edit the text (also including Cut, Replace and Paste)
and you cannot load text from file. It further works pretty much 
the same as a text edit dialog. Text view dialogs are also used 
for the on-line help.

2.13 On-line Help
</H1>
The on-line help is kept as simple as possible, because it
is possible to read this user manual as HTML document,
including hyper-links and with an index and a table of contents.
It is not our intention to duplicate everything in the 
form of on-line help built-in in the editors. There is a collection 
of Help menu entries
and each Help menu entry pops up a text view dialog.
The on-line help contains the basic bare minimal that you have 
to know to be able to work with the editor. From the on-line help dialog you can save
the text to a file, print it as PostScript or you can copy some 
of it to the clipboard. Furthermore, there is a Find command.
The Help menu of the editors<A NAME="2047">&#160;</A> contains the following topics:

<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Getting Started</B>
advises what you can do best when you start up this tool for
