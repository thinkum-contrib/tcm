3. Diagram Editing
</H1>

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00510000000000000000">
3.1 Definitions</A>
</H1>

<P>
Diagrams that are made by some TCM diagram
editor are a special kind of <B>graph</B><A NAME="3019">&#160;</A> with a 
certain <B>representation</B><A NAME="3021">&#160;</A> (layout, view). 
Each TCM editor is a specialization of the generic graph editor. 
A graph consists of a set of <B>subjects</B>.<A NAME="3023">&#160;</A> A subject 
is either a <B>node</B><A NAME="3025">&#160;</A> or an <B>edge</B><A NAME="3027">&#160;</A> that
connects two subjects.
Subjects are of different <B>node types</B><A NAME="3029">&#160;</A> 
and <B>edge types</B>.<A NAME="3031">&#160;</A> For example, a TDFD 
data flow diagram graph consists amongst others of nodes of type data 
process and nodes of type data store, and edges of type data flow.

<P>
The graphs that are edited with TCM contain edges that connect exactly
two (not necessarily different) subjects. So some kind of special
relationship between more than two nodes, for instance the specialization 
relationship in an ER diagram (made by the TESD editor), is specified in 
TCM as a node (a taxonomy junction node in this case) that is connected 
by three or more different edges (generalization or is-a relationship 
edges in this case).

<P>
In general, edges connect two (not necessarily) different subjects.
So in principle it is possible that an edge connects to another edge.
This feature is available in the generic diagram editor (TGD) and
also in a limited form in a few of the specific diagram editors.
In the other editors an edge connects only nodes, it never connects
edges.

<P>
In a representation of a graph, nodes and edges are shown 
as <B>shapes</B>.<A NAME="3033">&#160;</A> 
In the case of nodes the representing shapes are boxes, 
diamonds, ellipses etc. In the case of edges, shapes
are lines, arrows etc. In general, there is a many-many 
relationship between a certain subject type and a certain shape type 
and also between a particular subject instance and a particular 
shape instance. It is possible that a subject type is represented by 
more than one shape type. For instance a class-diagram
made by TSSD can contain different kinds of class boxes (e.g. boxes 
with three compartments that show the class name, attributes and operations, 
and boxes that only contain two compartment to show only the name and
the attributes).  Also, it is possible that a particular subject 
instance is represented by more than one shape instance. This feature
can be used when you want to represent the same subject at different 
positions in the same diagram (duplication).
But in most cases, the relationship  between subjects and their representations is one-one
and for this reason, subjects and their shape representations will often be mixed up.

<P>
A <B>TCM diagram</B><A NAME="3035">&#160;</A>
is composed of a graph, its representing shapes,
and extra diagram information, such as the diagram name, the author 
and the creation date.
A TCM diagram has an empty graph after creation. You can build a
graph by interactively drawing it with the TCM user interface, 
node by node, edge by edge.

<P>
Some diagrams are <B>hierarchic.</B><A NAME="3037">&#160;</A><A NAME="3038">&#160;</A>
This means that the underlying mathematical structure is a <B>hierarchic graph</B><A NAME="3040">&#160;</A> rather than a graph.
In a hierarchic graph, nodes are organized in trees:
a node may be a child of another node.
The parent-child relationship is represented by inclusion:
a node shape contains the node shapes of its children.
(In hierarchic documents, duplication is forbidden.
This ensures that the parent-child relationship is acyclic.)
In non-hierarchic diagrams, overlapping of nodes has no special meaning.

<P>
TCM documents should satisfy certain <B>constraints</B>.
<A NAME="3042">&#160;</A> Most constraints are specific for the particular 
diagram technique supported by the editor. Many constraints 
are checked by TCM. The constraints that are checked, are classified 
according to how TCM deals with possible violations.
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>1.
<DD><B>Built-in constraints</B>.<A NAME="3045">&#160;</A>
<A NAME="3046">&#160;</A> These are constraints which are built-in
and which can never be violated because there is no command in the
user interface to achieve that. We give two examples of built-in constraints: 
1. an edge connects exactly two (not necessarily different) existing subjects, 
2. an entity type in TESD is always represented by a box or a double box.
<P>
<DT>2.
<DD><B>Immediately enforced constraints</B>.
These are constraints that are immediately enforced by TCM if that is
<A NAME="3048">&#160;</A><A NAME="3049">&#160;</A>
possible.  When you perform a command that would violate 
a constraint that is immediately enforced, this command is rejected 
immediately by TCM and a pop-up window with an error message is displayed.
Examples of immediately enforced constraints are: 1. an entity type 
and a relationship node in TESD cannot be connected by a Generalization 
and 2. two entity types cannot have the same (non-empty) name.

<P>
<DT>3.
<DD><B>Soft constraints</B>.<A NAME="3051">&#160;</A><A NAME="3052">&#160;</A>
These are constraints that can be violated. 
Soft constraints are needed because the TCM user interface 
demands that you draw only one node or one edge at the time, and 
only edit the label of an existing subject. 
So there are certain commands that produce diagrams 
that might violate a constraint and that can not
be immediately enforced.
Two examples of soft constraints are:
1. all entity types have a non-empty name and 2. 
a relationship node in TESD should be connected to entity type nodes by 
two or more different edges.

<P>
Soft constraints are checked by TCM when the <B>Check Document</B> 
<A NAME="3054">&#160;</A> command is issued by you.
Check Document displays a list of error messages in a pop-up window
and the nodes and edges that cause these errors are selected in
the diagram. As opposed to the previous two classes of constraints, you
are responsible for correcting the diagram.

<P>
</DL>
<P>
It is possible that some immediately enforced constraints can still be 
violated by some user command. Such a constraint is then classified
as both an immediately enforced and a soft constraint. Example:
if a part of a diagram is copied and pasted into the same diagram, 
the unique name constraint is a soft constraint as it can be 
violated by the paste command. But when you have edited the text 
of one of the nodes in the diagram, and you issue the stop edit command, 
the unique name constraint can and will be immediately enforced.

3.2 Creating Nodes
</H1>
The set of tiled buttons labeled <TT>Nodes</TT>, at the left
side of the main window, contains 
radio buttons indicating the current type of node that 
can be created. You can change the current node type 
selection by clicking another tiled button with button-1. 

<P>
For creating a node, first choose the desired node type from 
the node tiles. Click button-1 in the background of the
drawing area, at the desired position. A new node shape appears, 
having its center at the position where is clicked and having the 
shape as indicated by the selected node type in the tiles.
The node shape is surrounded by a set of <B>selection handles</B> 
which are black or grey rectangles, showing that the shape is selected.
Selection handles of a node shape are also used for resizing 
the node.<A NAME="3061">&#160;</A><A NAME="3062">&#160;</A>

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00530000000000000000">&#160;</A><A NAME="3064">&#160;</A><A NAME="3065">&#160;</A>
<BR>
3.3 Creating Edges
</H1>
The set of tiled buttons named <TT>Edges</TT> contains radio 
buttons indicating the current type of edge that can be drawn. 
Furthermore there is a so-called check button labeled 
<TT>create curve</TT>.
If the curve button is on, new edges that are created
are drawn as a Bezier curve.
If the curve button is off, a multi-segment line is 
drawn as a set of connected straight 
line segments.  To create a new edge, first choose the desired 
edge type in the edge tiles. There are three sorts of edges 
that you can create:
<UL>
<LI><B>Straight edges</B>.<A NAME="3070">&#160;</A><A NAME="3071">&#160;</A>
Drag with button-2 from a node to a 
node. This means you push and hold down button-2 somewhere inside the 
source node and move the mouse with button-2 still pushed down.
During dragging the mouse pointer turns into 
a&nbsp;
<!-- MATH: $\epsfig{figure=p/sightP.ps}$ -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="25" HEIGHT="25" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="usersguideimg22.gif"
 ALT="\epsfig{figure=p/sightP.ps}">
and a line from the source node
follows the movement of the mouse.<A NAME="3073">&#160;</A>
You can always abort creating an edge while dragging by 
clicking button-1. When you are arrived in the target node and 
release button-2, then a straight edge is created. The two points 
of the edge at the borders of the connected nodes are called 
the <B>end points</B><A NAME="3075">&#160;</A> of the edge.

<P>
<LI><B>Segmented edges</B>.<A NAME="3077">&#160;</A><A NAME="3078">&#160;</A>
These edges consist of more than one segment. The points where
the segments are connected are called <B>intermediate points</B>.
<A NAME="3080">&#160;</A> To create such a segmented edge, release
button-2 in the background while you are dragging. Then the first 
intermediate point is created. After that, the line follows the mouse 
all by itself. Then you can add another intermediate point by 
clicking button-2 somewhere else in the background. You 
complete the edge by moving into the target node and clicking 
button-2.

<P>
<LI>
<B>Curved edges</B>.<A NAME="3082">&#160;</A><A NAME="3083">&#160;</A> 
<A NAME="3084">&#160;</A>
You can also create an edge drawn as a Bezier curve&nbsp;<A NAME="tex2html53"
 HREF="#foot3559"><SUP>3.1</SUP></A>. 
For this, turn on the create curve toggle button in the tiled menu. 
The Bezier curve requires <I>exactly two</I> intermediate points, 
which makes four edge points in total. These intermediate points 
are added in the same way as creating normal multiple line segments as 
described for segmented edges. When the four points are 
determined, a smooth curve is drawn between the end points and
the two intermediate points act as controlling points.
You can toggle between the curved and segmented edge representation 
by invoking the <B>Convert From/To Curves</B> 
<A NAME="3089">&#160;</A> command from the Edit menu.

<P>
After creating the edge, the edge is selected which is visible by a selection
handle on each line point. You can adjust the line points by 
moving the handles; see section&nbsp;<A HREF="usersguidenode5.html#MovingShapes">3.6</A>.

<P>
When an edge is created and it is the only <I>straight</I> edge 
connecting this particular couple of nodes, it will go (virtually) through 
the center points of the nodes. When there are multiple straight edges 
connecting the same pair of nodes, they will be equally distributed 
by default over the opposing sides.
Segmented and curved edges are not equally distributed when they
connect the same pair of nodes. TCM tries to intersect the first 
and last segment of a segmented line orthogonally with the sides of the 
connected nodes. If this is geometrically impossible, the segment will 
be directed to the center of the node like with straight edges. 
For understanding how it works it helps when you try it out
yourself.

<P>
<B>Tip:</B> When you want to enforce that a straight edge is always 
orthogonal to a node, then you can draw a segmented line of three points that
looks like a straight line. You enforce then that the line is always 
connected orthogonally with both of the nodes (providing that this 
is geometrically possible). This gives often a more pleasant optical result 
especially when you want to connect two nodes that differ a lot 
in size. 

<P>
It is possible to move the end points of an edge as well, in the
same way as you move the intermediate points. When you drag with
button-1 the handle of an end point to another position then the new 
end point will be the position at the border of the node shape that is 
the closest to where you released the handle. However, when you drag with
button-1 the handle of an end point into <I>a different</I> node shape 
then the edge will be <B>redirected</B> to that node. This means that
you can change the nodes that an edge connects.<A NAME="3103">&#160;</A>
<A NAME="3104">&#160;</A>

<P>
After an edge is created you can add
<A NAME="3105">&#160;</A><A NAME="3106">&#160;</A>
extra intermediate points. When you drag with button-1 on an existing 
line, a new intermediate point is 
created at the position where you stop dragging, and a new segment will be 
added to the line. 
Press Button-2 on a line handle to 
<A NAME="3107">&#160;</A><A NAME="3108">&#160;</A>
remove the line handle/segment from an existing line.

<P>
In TGD and some other editors it is possible to connect an edge with an edge
like in figure&nbsp;<A HREF="usersguidenode5.html#EdgeEdge">3.2</A>. You create these kinds of edges in the same way
as edges that connect nodes. Only you start to press button-2 while the 
mouse pointer is positioned at an edge and/or you release button-2, after dragging, 
when the mouse is on some edge.

3.4 Selection Commands
</H1>
The current selection is a subset of the displayed shapes. 
Shapes in the selection have visible selection handles.
The shape in the selection that was first selected has
black selection handles and the other shapes in the selection
have grey selection handles.

<P>
Shapes have a <B>selection area.</B>
For lines, it is a band around the segment(s) of the line.
The selection area for node shapes changes when you toggle hierarchy on or off:
In non-hierarchic documents, it is just the inside of the node shape.
In hierarchic documents,
the selection area is a band around the visible parts of the node shape
(boundary lines, interior lines, text labels).

<P>
The following operations on the selection exist:

<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Select a single shape</B>.<A NAME="3122">&#160;</A>
	Click button-1 in the selection area of an unselected shape
	(node shape, line).
	The selection will contain only this shape
	which will show black handles.

<P>
<LI><B>Add a shape to the selection</B>.<A NAME="3124">&#160;</A>
	Click button-2 in the selection area of an unselected shape.
	The first selected shape will show black selection handles,
	the other selected shapes will show grey selection handles.

<P>
<LI><B>Remove a shape from the selection</B>.<A NAME="3126">&#160;</A>
	Click button-2 in the selection area of a selected shape.
	The selection handles disappear.

<P>
<LI><B>Empty the selection</B>.<A NAME="3128">&#160;</A>
	Click button-2 somewhere in the background.
	All selection handles disappear.

<P>
<LI><B>Select a part of the diagram</B>. Drag button-1 starting
in the background. The area that you are selecting, is enclosed by 
a stippled box, and its bottom-right corner is attached to the
mouse. If you release button-1 then every shape that was (partly)
inside the stippled box is selected and every other shape outside 
the box is unselected. One of these selected shapes will show 
black selection handles, the others will become grey.<A NAME="3130">&#160;</A>

<P>
<LI><B>Make selected shape first selected</B>.
	You can enforce that a selected shape is the first selected
	by clicking button-1 in the selection area of an already selected (grey) shape.
	The selection handles of the old first selected shape will become grey
	and the clicked shape's handles will become black.

<P>
<LI>The <B>Select All</B> command from the Edit menu<A NAME="3133">&#160;</A>
	selects all shapes of the diagram.
	By clicking button-2 in the background you deselect all shapes.

3.5 Editing Text
</H1> 

<P>
For getting into edit mode make sure that the shape with the label that 
you want to edit is the only selected shape.
When you move the mouse pointer into the single selected shape,
the mouse pointer turns into a&nbsp;
<!-- MATH: $\epsfig{figure=p/ibeamP.ps}$ -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="16" HEIGHT="24" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="usersguideimg10.gif"
 ALT="\epsfig{figure=p/ibeamP.ps}">.
By clicking button-1 on the shape or typing the first character
you go into edit mode. See section&nbsp;<A HREF="usersguidenode4.html#EditingText">2.5.1</A> for the different 
text edit commands that exist in TCM. These apply to all document
editors including all diagram editors. 

<P>
Every TCM diagram and tree editor has a special node type called 
<B>Comment</B>,<A NAME="3141">&#160;</A> which solely consists of a text label
and is intended to add comment to the diagram. 
This node type cannot be connected by any other edge, except
in the generic diagram editor, TGD. But comment nodes can be 
selected, moved and of course edited, like any other node type.

<B>Tip:</B> If you want to edit the label of an edge, and you try to select it
first with button-1 you could miss the edge and create an unwanted node.
To avoid this, make the selection empty and select the edge by
button-2 instead, because, when you miss no node is created.

3.6 Moving Shapes
</H1>
You can reposition the following things in a diagram:

<P>
<UL>
<LI><A NAME="3153">&#160;</A>
<B>A node shape</B>. You can move a node shape by positioning 
the mouse into 
that node shape and then drag it with button-1. The shape does
not need to be selected. A grey node outline
moves along with the mouse. The mouse pointer turns 
into a&nbsp;

<IMG
 WIDTH="22" HEIGHT="23" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"

If you release button-1 then this node shape is redrawn at the 
new position and all its adjacent lines are redrawn too.

<P>
<LI><A NAME="3156">&#160;</A>
<B>The selection</B>. If you drag one of the selected node 
shapes, all other selected shapes are moved with over the 
same distance, including the line handles of the 
selected edges.

<P>
<LI><A NAME="3158">&#160;</A>
<B>Intermediate line handle</B>. You cannot move the line as a whole,
but you can drag the individual handles of a line. When a line is 
selected and the mouse is in one of the handles
(which is indicated by a&nbsp;
<!-- MATH: $\epsfig{figure=p/movingP.ps}$ -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="22" HEIGHT="23" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="usersguideimg26.gif"
 ALT="\epsfig{figure=p/movingP.ps}">), then 
you can drag with button-1 this handle
and a grey outline of the new line follows the mouse. You can move 
the intermediate handles of a line to an arbitrary place in the drawing
area.

<P>
When you drag a line outside a line handle with button-1, a
new line handle will be created 
<A NAME="3161">&#160;</A><A NAME="3162">&#160;</A>
and the line is extended with
an extra segment.
When you hit a line handle with button-2 (instead of button-1), the
line handle is deleted 
<A NAME="3163">&#160;</A><A NAME="3164">&#160;</A>
and consequently the line will be deprived of
a segment.

<P>
<LI><A NAME="3165">&#160;</A>
<B>End line handle</B>. When you drag and release one 
of the end point handles with button-1 into the connected node 
or somewhere in the background, then the end point will be 
placed at the border of the connected node at a position 
that is the closest to the place where the handle was released.
However, when you drag the handle into a different node then 
the edge will be <B>redirected</B><A NAME="3168">&#160;</A> to that
node. The result is that the edge now connects to a different 
node&nbsp;<A NAME="tex2html56"
 HREF="#foot3169"><SUP>3.2</SUP></A>.

<P>
<LI><A NAME="3170">&#160;</A>
<B>The label of an edge</B>. You can move the label of an edge by 
dragging it with button-1. The edge need not be selected. You 
cannot move the label of a node; when you move or resize a node,
the label positions inside the node are recalculated, as well
as the labels of the adjacent edges.

<P>
<A NAME="3172">&#160;</A>
<LI>The <B>Align nodes</B> command in the Edit menu has six 
variants as you can see in the Align Nodes submenu of the Edit menu. 
See figure&nbsp;<A HREF="usersguidenode5.html#AlignNodes">3.4</A> for the various alignments.
The alignment takes place according to the position and size of 
the first selected shape, which should be
a node shape. Depending on the chosen alignment
type, the rest of the nodes in the selection will be 
aligned to the first shape, either horizontally 
(same center y-coordinates), 
vertically (same center x-coordinates), to the top 
(same top y-coordinates), to the bottom (same bottom y-coordinates), 
to the left (same left x-coordinates) or to the right 
(same right x-coordinates).

3.7 Resizing Shapes
</H1>
Resizing a node shape in all directions is possible by 
dragging button-1 on the selection handles. 
The mouse pointer 
turns into one of the eight symbols that indicate to what
direction the node shape can be resized: 
<!-- MATH: $\epsfig{figure=p/8sizeP.ps}$ -->
<IMG
 WIDTH="66" HEIGHT="66" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="usersguideimg28.gif"
 ALT="\epsfig{figure=p/8sizeP.ps}">.
You can use button-2 to resize a node shape in the desired direction only.
When you want to abort the command while you are resizing,
you have to click button-2.<A NAME="3187">&#160;</A>

<P>
Unlike moving, resizing only works on one shape at the time i.e. it does not influence the other shapes of the selection.
If you want to resize multiple shapes in one command then
you could use the Same Size command in the Edit menu.
The <B>Same Size</B><A NAME="3189">&#160;</A> command makes the 
size of all selected node shapes the same size as the first selected 
shape (the shape with the black handles). The first selected shape 
should be a node shape of course. The edges in the rest of 
the selection are ignored by this command.

<P>
<B>Tip:</B> when node shapes have been moved or resized then their 
adjacent edges are redrawn and all their handles and labels are placed 
back to their default positions. This is sometimes 
undesirable&nbsp;<A NAME="tex2html57"
 HREF="#foot3191"><SUP>3.3</SUP></A>. To avoid that your effort gets lost, postpone moving
edge labels and handles to their final positions until when you 
think that the connected nodes are OK. Draw the graph first and 
then you can bother about the layout.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00580000000000000000">&#160;</A><A NAME="DeleteSubjects">&#160;</A><A NAME="3194">&#160;</A><A NAME="3195">&#160;</A>
<BR>
3.8 Deleting Subjects
</H1>
The edit command <B>Delete</B> (called from the Edit menu, or by the 
accelerator &lt;Ctrl+D&gt;), removes all subjects from the selection. 
If a node is deleted then all its adjacent edges are deleted too.
If a node has duplicate shapes (see section&nbsp;<A HREF="usersguidenode5.html#Duplicates">3.10</A>) of which 
some but not all are selected then a question dialog is raised asking 
whether you want to delete all duplicates (and henceforth the node in the 
graph) or that you only want to delete the selected duplicate shapes.

<P>
The Edit menu command <B>Delete All</B> removes all subjects,
selected or not. Before the command is executed, you are first asked 
by means of a question dialog if you really want to delete
everything.<A NAME="3200">&#160;</A>

<P>
Fortunately, like all commands, deletion commands can be undone 
with Undo. 

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00590000000000000000">&#160;</A><A NAME="3202">&#160;</A><A NAME="3203">&#160;</A>
<BR>
3.9 Cutting and Pasting Subjects
</H1>
The diagram editors have a <B>buffer</B> for cutting, copying 
and<A NAME="3205">&#160;</A> <A NAME="PasteSubjects">&#160;</A>pasting parts of a diagram (selected shapes plus the subjects that 
they represent) inside the same editor.

<P>
You can either <B>Cut (</B>&lt;<B>Ctrl+X</B>&gt;<B>)</B> or <B>Copy (</B>&lt;<B>Ctrl+C</B>&gt;<B>)</B> the 
selection to the buffer.<A NAME="3209">&#160;</A><A NAME="3210">&#160;</A>
When you perform a cut, all selected subjects are copied into the 
buffer, and the selection is removed from the diagram (including
the unselected edges that are adjacent to the selected nodes).
When you perform a copy,<A NAME="3211">&#160;</A><A NAME="3212">&#160;</A> no subjects are 
removed from a diagram, but a copy of the selection is 
made and put into the buffer.
Both Cut and Copy copy the unselected nodes that are 
connected by selected edges into the paste buffer.

<P>
Pasting means that the contents of the paste buffer is being copied
into the diagram. When you perform a <B>Paste (&lt;Ctrl+Y&gt;)</B> 
command, a stippled box is shown that has the size of the 
pasted area which is attached to the mouse pointer near its top-left corner. 
When you click button-1, the subjects in the paste
buffer are copied into the diagram. The Append Diagram command is 
also implemented as a paste command. When you want to abort pasting 
while you are moving the paste box, you have to click button-2.<A NAME="3214">&#160;</A>

<P>
You can paste the same contents of the paste buffer more than once
because always a copy of the contents is made.
Pasted nodes and edges are new nodes and edges, not duplicates
of existing nodes or edges.
The paste buffer remains intact when you load another diagram,
so it is possible to cut and paste between different diagrams
(but only in the same editor). 

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION005100000000000000000">&#160;</A> <A NAME="Duplicates">&#160;</A><A NAME="3217">&#160;</A><A NAME="3218">&#160;</A>
<A NAME="3219">&#160;</A>
<BR>
3.10 Creating and Deleting Duplicates of a Node
</H1>

<P>
It is possible to represent one node by several instances of
the same shape in non-hierarchic diagrams.
The <B>Duplicate</B> command copies the node shapes in the
selection and puts them into a box, lust like the Paste command.
However, the
duplicate command does not make use of the paste buffer. 
The copied node shapes can be positioned at an arbitrary place,
just like the Paste command. Edges cannot be 
duplicated&nbsp;<A NAME="tex2html58"
 HREF="#foot3221"><SUP>3.4</SUP></A>.
Unlike the Copy command, the new node shapes have the same node 
subject as the original. When a node has duplicate shapes then 
all these shapes have a small asterisk in the top-left corner.

<P>
When the label of a duplicate shape is updated then all its 
duplicate shapes are updated too and when a node is deleted 
(with Delete) then all the duplicate shapes of this node are 
deleted too by that command. 

<P>
The duplicate command is intended to be used when the same node 
has to be represented at different places to avoid cluttering
up the diagram. For instance, in a DFD, the same external 
entity or data store is often drawn at different positions 
in the same diagram, and TCM keeps track that these are
in reality representations of the same subjects.

<P>
The <B>Delete</B> command can be used to delete all selected 
duplicate shapes, see section&nbsp;<A HREF="usersguidenode5.html#DeleteSubjects">3.8</A>. 
When all the shapes of a node are deleted then the node itself 
is deleted too. But you can delete individual duplicate 
shapes as well.

A font consists
of the attributes font family, font style and point size. 
For each of the three attributes there is a list of toggle buttons.
Also, each list of toggle buttons in the dialog has an extra check 
button called <TT>update</TT> <I>attribute</I> that indicates whether 
that font particular attribute should be updated or not. 
This makes it possible, for instance, to only change point sizes
or font families of some texts but to keep the other font

The dialog also shows a preview of some text in the selected font
so you can see how it will look in your diagram.
When you press the <TT>Apply</TT>-button then the dialog is dismissed and

in which you can type arbitrary text to annotate the subject.
See section&nbsp;<A HREF="usersguidenode4.html#TextEditDialog">2.5</A> for using the text edit dialogs.

<P>
<LI>With the <B>Find</B> menu entry in the Search menu you 
call<A NAME="3272">&#160;</A><A NAME="3273">&#160;</A>
a dialog in which you can search for some text string in 
the diagram. The find dialog is described in section&nbsp;<A HREF="usersguidenode4.html#TextEditor">2.5.3</A>.
From this dialog you can <B>find the next text</B> or 
<B>find all texts</B> that matches the string to find.
In the first case, the first shape that is found is 
selected and the scrollbars of the main window are moved to 
center the shape in the main window. When you click <TT>Find Next</TT> 
again, the next shape is selected (round-robin). 
When you choose <TT>Find All</TT>, all shapes that contain a string 
that matches are selected.

<P>
<LI>With the <B>Replace</B> menu entry in the Search menu you 
call<A NAME="3280">&#160;</A><A NAME="3281">&#160;</A>
a dialog in which you can replace texts in the diagram.
The replace dialog is described in section&nbsp;<A HREF="usersguidenode4.html#TextEditor">2.5.3</A>.
It has a find next command that works the same as in the
find dialog. Furthermore, the replace dialog has a replace next 
and a replace all button. <B>Replace next</B> means that for the next
shape (the shape that is found with find next) all their text 
strings that match are substituted by the string to replace
(that is the second string filled in in the dialog). 
In the case of <B>Replace all</B> this happens to all shapes in one
command (global substitution).

<P>
</UL>
<P>
Note that find and replace work on entire shapes at the 
same time. But keep in mind that a shape could have multiple 
text labels and each individual text label could match the string 
to find or the string to replace multiple times (at least when you 
look for a substring). When you want to find or replace within a single 
text label or table cell, you should load that text label first in 
the out-line text editor and then do a find or replace within that dialog.
The out-line text editor only works on a single text shape at the
time.

<P>
Note also that you can fill an empty string for the string to find
in both dialogs. An empty string matches only the text shapes 
that are empty. You can also fill in an empty string in the replace 
with text field, providing that the string to find field is not 
empty.

3.13 Undo and Redo
</H1>
The last issued edit commands can always be undone and, when undone, also redone
again. <B>Undo</B> is the first entry of the Edit menu (in the menu bar and 
also under button-3). Undo has the accelerator &lt;Ctrl+U&gt;. 
Undo is multiple levels deep. <B>Redo</B> is the second entry of the Edit menu
and has the accelerator &lt;Ctrl+R&gt;. You can redo the last undone
commands. Redo is also multiple levels. However, when you have undone a command
and then issued a new command then the undone command can not be redone anymore.
Both undo as redo show in their menu entry the name of the command that
can be undone respectively redone. In the current implementation the undo can
be several hundreds of levels deep, but when a new diagram is created by 
Load or New, the undo history is deleted. When undo or redo is not possible,
the corresponding menu entry is shaded and can not be issued. 

<P>
While you are busy performing a command, like creating an edge, moving
the paste box or resizing or moving some shapes, you can abort the
command by clicking button-1 during edge creation or button-2
for the other commands. When you have aborted, nothing is changed and the
undo or redo of that command is not possible nor necessary and the undo menu 
entry lists the command issued before the aborted command.

<P>
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="usersguidenode5.html#AtomicEditCommands">3.6</A> summarizes all atomic commands

3.14 The Generic Diagram Editor (TGD)
</H1>

<P>
The generic diagram editor is a diagram editor that has 
all the features that are described in this chapter. 

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION005141000000000000000">
3.14.1 Nodes and Edges</A>
</H2>

<P>
<A NAME="3306">&#160;</A><A NAME="3307">&#160;</A>
The generic diagram editor has three node types <B>generic node</B>,
<B>empty node</B> and <B>comment</B>, and one edge type, <B>generic edge</B>. 
Empty nodes are nodes that don't have a name label. TGD has 
no immediately enforced and no soft constraints. A generic or empty
node can be represented by a number of node shape types and a 
generic edge can be represented by a number of line types, 
see figure&nbsp;<A HREF="usersguidenode5.html#GDRepresentations">3.8</A>.

<P>
Each node shape and each line can be drawn in the line styles
solid, dashed or dotted. You can set the default line style
of the node shapes via an option menu below the tiled node buttons
in the main window. The default line style for lines can be
set via the same kind of option menu below the tiled edge buttons.
The line style of a node shape or line can be changed via
the Update Line Style command in the properties menu. This command
sets the line style of all selected shapes to the chosen line style.

<P>
All node shapes in TGD, except comments, bulls eyes, black dots and 
solid horizontal and vertical bars can have an index text label. 
If you want to see these text labels select the <TT>create/edit index</TT>
<A NAME="3314">&#160;</A><A NAME="3315">&#160;</A> <A NAME="3316">&#160;</A> toggle button 
below the node tiled buttons. By default the index labels are numbers 
between 1 and the total number of nodes having an index. Each new node 
shape will get the lowest currently unused index number higher than 0. 
When you deselect the <TT>create/edit index</TT> toggle, all node indexes 
remain visible, but new node shapes will not get an index number.
When the <TT>create/edit index</TT> toggle is selected you can edit the node 
indexes just like the name of a node. You can create a new index label
for a node shape by editing the empty index label of the node shape.
The node index can be made any string in TGD. If you issue the 
Renumber Indexes<A NAME="3319">&#160;</A><A NAME="3320">&#160;</A>
command from the Edit menu of TGD then the current indexes of the diagram
are renumbered. Each node shape that has an index will get as index
a unique number between 1 and the total number of node shapes with an
index.

<P>
In TGD it is possible to convert between different node shape types.
For this, select the shapes that you want to convert to some other
node shape type and choose the desired shape type from the submenu
of <TT>Convert Node Shape Type</TT> in the Edit 
menu.<A NAME="3322">&#160;</A><A NAME="3323">&#160;</A>
This will pop up a dialog window containing toggle buttons for the
various node shape types you can convert to.
See figure&nbsp;<A HREF="usersguidenode5.html#ConvertNodeShapeTypes">3.7</A> for the available node shape types.
This makes it possible to change a box in an ellipse or vice versa.
Note however that only the representation is changed. The node itself
is not changed.

In TGD, every node, including comment nodes, can be connected by any 
type of edge and given the facts that you can make comment nodes 
invisible by emptying its text string or make the line style of
a node shape invisible and that you can connect edges with edges too, 
you can make very complex drawings in TGD. The arrows and other kinds 
of line endings of the lines in TGD can be changed via the Update Line 
End command in the Properties menu.

<DD>But imagine the situation that labels do
not move when nodes and edges are moved, that would be far more

<DD>Duplicate lines are meaningful too in
