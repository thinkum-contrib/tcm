The Toolkit for Conceptual Modeling (TCM) is a collection of software tools
to represent conceptual models of software systems in the form of diagrams,
tables, trees, etc. A <B>conceptual model</B><A NAME="136">&#160;</A>
of a system is a structure used to represent the requirements or architecture of 
the system. TCM is meant to be used for specifying and maintaining requirements 
for desired systems, in which a number of techniques and heuristics for problem
analysis, function refinement, behavior specification, and architecture
specification are used. TCM takes the form of a suite of graphical editors
that can be used in these design tasks. 

<P>
During software development, a number of stakeholders must reach a common understanding 
of the behavior and structure of the software. These are for example users and sponsors 
(or their representatives), analysts, designers and programmers. An important function 
of conceptual models is to facilitate this understanding.

<P>
The notations for software specifications that are supported by TCM are explained 
in appendix&nbsp;<A HREF="usersguidenode11.html#MiniTut">A</A>. A more detailed analysis of the nature and use of some of 
these techniques and heuristics in various existing methods for software specification 
is presented in the book&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="usersguidenode14.html#Wieringa96-01">22</A>]. The UML diagram techniques are 
discussed in&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="usersguidenode14.html#Wieringa99-01">23</A>]. Bibliographic references can be found on

All editors look very similar and have many operations
in common. All diagram editors have almost the same set of edit commands
and all table editors have almost the same set of edit commands.
TCM supports constraint checking for single
documents (e.g. name duplication, cycles in is-a relationships).
TCM distinguishes built-in constraints (of which a violation cannot even 
be attempted) from immediate constraints (of which an attempted violation 
is immediately prevented) and soft constraints (against which the editor 
provides a warning when it checks the drawing). As of version 2.10 TCM 
support hierarchic graphs, so that it can handle for example hierarchic 
statecharts. Features to be added later include constraint checking 
across documents and executable models.

1.1.3 Using TCM in Software Specification</A>
</H2>

<P>
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="usersguidenode3.html#TCMMethods">1.1</A> gives an overview of how the different document 
editors in TCM can be used in various methods for software 
specification. Each of these methods uses a subset of the notations 
available in TCM and defines a number of consistency rules<A NAME="301">&#160;</A> 
across notations. Thus, each method allows the specification 
of a model of the required
software product and uses different notations to specify different views
upon this model.  The consistency rules guarantee that there <EM>is</EM> 
a model that is being specified.
Views that are inconsistent according to these rules, do not represent a
model. The consistency rules of ER, DF and JSD are defined
in&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="usersguidenode14.html#Wieringa96-01">22</A>] 
and the consistency rules of YSM are defined in&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="usersguidenode14.html#YSM93">31</A>]. 
The current TCM version does not yet implement all 
the consistency rules of these methods. The implementation of 
consistency rules of these methods is planned for TCM 
version 3.0 as is described in&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="usersguidenode14.html#Dehne96c">6</A>].

<P>
The same applies to object oriented (OO) methods, in particular those 
using UML. TCM currently contains a number of tools for drawing diagrams
for OO models, albeit sometimes incomplete or in a bit different notation 
than the standard. However, in the future we want to build support for 
integrated OO modeling with UML into TCM as well.

<P>
In TCM there is and will be no consistency checking for other
methods such as the ISAC&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="usersguidenode14.html#Lundeberg81">12</A>] and Information 
Engineering&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="usersguidenode14.html#Martin89abc">13</A>] methods. But tools for TCM 
can be used to draw the diagrams.

designed to be as intuitive as possible and to be proof 
against users who are trying things at random. The most 
important commands that you need are explained in the on-line 
help windows.

<P>
This manual is intended to be a reference manual for the user in
the first place, hence the amount of details.
You certainly need not read it all to be able to use TCM.
Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="usersguidenode4.html#DocumentEditing">2</A> describes the common features 
between all TCM editors, such as saving documents, loading 
documents, printing documents etc. 
Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="usersguidenode5.html#DiagramEditing">3</A> describes 
how you edit a diagram abstracting from a particular diagram editor.

specific to the different diagram editors, grouped by data
view editors, behavior view editors and function view editors,
respectively. These chapters are organized in the same order 
as the list of diagram editors in section&nbsp;<A HREF="usersguidenode3.html#IncludedTCM">1.1.2</A>.
Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="usersguidenode9.html#TableEditing">7</A> describes how you can edit tables 
in general and it explains the (small) differences between

1.4 Installation and Getting Started
</H1>
 
TCM runs on Unix systems with X Windows version 11 release 5 or higher
and uses the Motif library release 1.2 or higher for
the graphical user interface. Instead of the official Motif it is also
possible to use the free Motif-clone <A NAME="tex2html15"
 HREF="http://www.lesstif.org">Lesstif</A>
or 
<A NAME="tex2html16"
 HREF="http://www.opengroup.org/openmotif">Open Motif</A>.
We had some problems running TCM under Lesstif in the past; please try 
to use Open Motif if at all possible.

<P>
For Linux we have made some distributions in which the Motif library
is already linked with the TCM executables. These statically linked
distributions carry the name <TT>statmotif</TT> as part of their name.
For using these distributions you don't need Motif, Open Motif or 
Lesstif at all.

<P>
For up-to-date system specific information see 
<A NAME="tex2html17"
 HREF="http://www.cs.utwente.nl/~tcm/software.html">http://www.cs.utwente.nl/~tcm/software.html</A>
and read also the
file <TT>INSTALL</TT> in one of the software distributions before you
install and use TCM.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00341000000000000000">
1.4.1 Unix tar-files with binaries</A>
</H2>

<P>
Most TCM distributions are in the form of a Unix <TT>tar</TT>
file compressed with the <TT>gzip</TT> program&nbsp;<A NAME="tex2html20"
 HREF="#foot678"><SUP>1.1</SUP></A>.
To install a binary distribution (a tar.gz file) unzip and untar the TCM
distribution by for instance: <TT>tar xzvfp 'distribution'.tar.gz</TT>.
If your tar-program does not know the <TT>z</TT>(unzip) option then
unzip the file explicitly by e.g. <TT>gunzip</TT>.
A new directory named tcm-'version'/ will be created in the current 
directory containing the TCM binaries and documentation in subdirectories.

<P>
For an explanation of the TCM (environment) variables mentioned below 
see section&nbsp;<A HREF="usersguidenode3.html#Arguments">1.4.5</A>.
Every user of TCM should set the <TT>TCM_HOME</TT> environment variable to the
directory where TCM is installed. It is recommended that they add
<TT>TCM_BIN</TT> to their <TT>PATH</TT> and add 
<TT>TCM_MAN</TT> to their <TT>MANPATH</TT> environment variable. 
TCM will not work when 
<TT>TCM_HOME</TT> is not set. Do not forget to export these variables. 
It is a good idea to set the variables in your <TT>.profile</TT> or <TT>.login</TT>
startup script of your Unix shell.

<P>
The distributions for Solaris contain shared object libraries. If you
have one of these distributions and you have TCM installed in a directory
other than <TT>/opt/tcm</TT>, each user should include this
directory in the <TT>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</TT> variable by for instance:
<TT>LD_LIBRARY_PATH=TCM_LIB:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH</TT>.
Users of Linux do not need to set <TT>LD_LIBRARY_PATH</TT>.
 
To configure amongst others the path names of some external Unix programs 
that are used by TCM you can modify the <TT>TCM_CONFIG/tcm.conf</TT> 
file.

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00342000000000000000">
1.4.2 RPM distributions with binaries</A>
</H2>

<P>
For Linux we have also provided the software in the form of
<A NAME="tex2html21"
 HREF="http://www.rpm.org">RPM packages</A>.
These distributions work with Redhat 6 and 7 and almost
certainly with any other Linux system that has support for RPM.
Install the distribution by:
<PRE>
rpm --install tcm-&lt;version&gt;.i386.rpm
</PRE>Or upgrade an existing distribution by:
<PRE>
rpm --upgrade tcm-&lt;version&gt;.i386.rpm
</PRE> 
By default TCM is installed in <TT>/opt/tcm</TT>. With the rpm option
<TT>-prefix </TT>&lt;<TT>dir</TT>&gt; you can install it in a different directory. Some of the
documentation will be installed by default in <BR> <TT>/usr/doc/tcm-</TT>&lt;<TT>version</TT>&gt;.
There are two sorts of binary RPMs. One contains the name <TT>statmotif</TT>
and the other <TT>dynmotif</TT>. The `statmotif' RPMs have Motif statically
linked into the executables. The `dynmotif' RPMs are dynamically
linked against Motif 1.2. It uses the libXm.so (version 1.2) of Motif, 
Open Motif or Lesstif on your system.

The RPM installation creates some initialization scripts for TCM in
<TT>/etc/profile.d</TT>. It is therefore not necessary to set yourself 
environment variables like for the tar.gz distribution.
You only have to login again before you start using TCM.

<DD>Call it from the program <TT>tcm</TT>. <TT>tcm</TT> displays a 
window containing a push button for each available editor
(see figure&nbsp;<A HREF="usersguidenode3.html#StartupWindow">1.2</A>).
To start an editor, click the corresponding button. 
The diagram and tree editors are started up immediately. 
When a table editor is chosen, first a dialog is displayed 
in which you can change some options. Be careful, because each 
time you click a button a new editor is started.
<P>
To kill the <TT>tcm</TT> startup program issue <TT>Quit</TT> from the 
File menu.  The processes of the running editors are independent from the 
running startup program, so when you quit a startup program, all 
other programs continue to run.

<P>
<DT>2.
<DD>Call the editor directly from the shell, e.g. <TT>tesd</TT>, <TT>tefd</TT>,
<TT>tssd</TT>. Perhaps you want to end the command with an ampersand
(like <TT>terd&amp;</TT>) to run it in the background.
You can supply a single document name as command line argument. 
If this argument is the name of an existing file then 
the editor tries to load a document from it. If the document does not 
exist, a new document is created in the editor having the 
argument as document name.
In section&nbsp;<A HREF="usersguidenode3.html#Arguments">1.4.5</A> we give an overview of the flags

1.4.5 Unix options, files and variables
</H2>

<P>
The Unix manual pages in the TCM distribution give an up-to-date overview
of all arguments, environment variables and files that are used
by TCM. Here we will give some explanation of the most important ones.
TCM has the following command line arguments:
<UL>
<P>
<LI><I>Filename</I>. This will be the document name when the editor is started, 
instead of <TT>untitled</TT>. If the file exists and contains a valid document for the 
concerning editor, the document is loaded while starting up. If the file does not 
exist, only the document name in the editor will be modified. 

<P>
<LI><TT>-drawing</TT> <I>Width</I><TT>x</TT><I>Height</I>.<A NAME="679">&#160;</A>
Specifies the size of the drawing area in pixels. The default size is 1330x1330 
pixels&nbsp;<A NAME="tex2html23"
 HREF="#foot680"><SUP>1.2</SUP></A>.
Increasing the values makes it possible to draw larger documents, but it can slow down 
the editor significantly. Smaller values make it possible to run TCM faster
on a machine with little memory. You can change the default size also in
the configuration file <TT>$TCM_HOME/lib/tcm.conf</TT>.

<P>
<LI><TT>-help</TT>.<A NAME="681">&#160;</A>
Write all allowed command line arguments to standard output and exit.

<P>
<LI><TT>-maxdrawing</TT> <I>Width</I><TT>x</TT><I>Height</I>.<A NAME="682">&#160;</A>
The drawing area can not be larger than <I>width</I> pixels wide and <I>height</I>
pixels high. The default maximum values are 3000x3000 pixels. When the drawing is larger 
than the current drawing area, the drawing area is made larger up to this maximum.
However, when the drawing area is extremely large, the editor becomes slower and 
may eventually crash because there were insufficient resources to allocate 
the background pixmap.

<P>
<LI><TT>-priv_cmap</TT>.<A NAME="683">&#160;</A>
Start the editor with a private color map. Normally editors use the default 
color map. When there are not enough colors available in the default
color map for the main window on startup, the editor is always started
with a private color map, whether this option is given or not.
It is possible to set in <TT>$TCM_HOME/lib/tcm.conf</TT> that you always
want to start editors with a private colormap.

<P>
<LI><TT>-projdir</TT> <I>directory</I>.<A NAME="684">&#160;</A> 
Set the project directory (working directory) to this directory.
Files are loaded from and saved in this directory.
<LI><TT>-version</TT>.<A NAME="685">&#160;</A> 
Write the TCM version to standard output and exit.

<P>
<LI>
In addition to these options, the standard X11 toolkit options 
such as <TT>-bg</TT> and <TT>-display</TT> 
are accepted as command line arguments (see the X window 
man page, X(1) or X11(7)).

<P>
</UL>
<P>
All editors additionally have some optional command 
line arguments to generate printable output directly from an 
existing document file. When these options are given, no 
windows are created, but the X display is used however,
so you should run X Windows with an opened display.
These options are:

<P>
<UL>
<P>
<LI><TT>-toEPS [</TT>&lt;<TT>outputfile</TT>&gt;<TT>.eps]</TT>.<A NAME="686">&#160;</A> 
Generate Encapsulated PostScript from existing document and write it to 
the optional <TT>&lt;outputfile&gt;.eps</TT> or standard output and exit.

<P>
<LI><TT>-toFig [</TT>&lt;<TT>outputfile</TT>&gt;<TT>.fig] [-latex]</TT>.
<A NAME="687">&#160;</A> 
Generate Fig format from existing document and write it to 
the optional &lt;<TT>outputfile</TT>&gt;<TT>.fig</TT> or standard output, when no
file name is given, and exit.
When the <TT>[-latex]</TT> option is given, L<SUP><SMALL>A</SMALL></SUP>T<SMALL>E</SMALL>X fonts are generated,
otherwise normal Postscript fonts are generated.
For more information about Xfig and its file format see
<A NAME="tex2html24"
 HREF="http://www.xfig.org/userman">http://www.xfig.org/userman</A>.

<P>
<LI><TT>-toPNG [</TT>&lt;<TT>outputfile</TT>&gt;<TT>.png]</TT>.<A NAME="688">&#160;</A> 
Generate PNG graphics format from an existing document and write it to 
optional &lt;<TT>outputfile</TT>&gt;<TT>.png</TT> or standard output and exit.
PNG is a format that is understood by most web browsers and by 
MS-Word. PNG is similar to the GIF-format but less controversial
(see <A NAME="tex2html25"

</UL>
<P>
Table editors additionally have the following optional command 
line arguments:
<UL>
<P>
<LI><TT>-cell</TT> <I>Width</I><TT>x</TT><I>Height</I>.<A NAME="690">&#160;</A>
Sets the default cell size of the table editor to <I>width</I> pixels 
wide and <I>height</I> pixels high.

<P>
<LI><TT>-table</TT> <I>Rows</I><TT>x</TT><I>Columns</I>.<A NAME="691">&#160;</A>

<UL>
<LI><TT>TCM_BIN/psf</TT>.<A NAME="692">&#160;</A><A NAME="550">&#160;</A>
A Perl script that is used to filter PostScript output written by TCM.
It assumes that the Perl interpreter is in <TT>/usr/bin/perl</TT>. Otherwise,
you have to edit the first line of <TT>$TCM_BIN/psf</TT> to make
it call your local interpreter&nbsp;<A NAME="tex2html28"
 HREF="#foot553"><SUP>1.3</SUP></A>. Psf is supplied with TCM and can be used stand 
alone as well, see <TT>man psf</TT>.

<P>
<LI><TT>TCM_BIN/text2ps</TT>.<A NAME="693">&#160;</A>
A small program that converts ASCII text files to PostScript. It is 
used by TCM for printing text, for instance the on-line help pages.
Text2ps is supplied with TCM and can also be used stand alone, 
see <TT>man text2ps</TT>.

<P>
<LI><TT>TCM_CONFIG/tcm.conf</TT>.<A NAME="694">&#160;</A><A NAME="560">&#160;</A>
This is the TCM configuration file. This file contains initialization values for the tools, 
like the default export format, the various print banner options, the default page size, 
the scale and grid settings etc. Each tool reads this file upon startup. 
The menu entries of the editor are initialized with
the values from the configuration file. The settings in <TT>tcm.conf</TT> 
are already set to default values, but, when you have installed 
TCM, feel free to adjust them to your favorite settings.
In the configuration file itself you find directions for how to modify it.

<P>
Some settings in <TT>tcm.conf</TT> are commented out such as
the name of the printer, the Unix commands to print a file, to view or 
remove a print request. The reason is that TCM normally determines
these settings itself but in case the commands are not found or the
wrong ones are chosen then they can be set explicitly in <TT>tcm.conf</TT>.

<P>
<LI><TT>$HOME/.tcmrc</TT>.<A NAME="565">&#160;</A><A NAME="566">&#160;</A>
Each user of TCM can override any setting in <TT>tcm.conf</TT>
by his own configuration file, which
has to be installed in <TT>$HOME/.tcmrc</TT>.
The file syntax should be the same as of the TCM configuration file 
<TT>tcm.conf</TT>, i.e. of the form <TT>{</TT> <I>option</I> <I>value</I> <TT>}</TT>.

<P>
<LI><TT>TCM_CONFIG/TCM</TT>.<A NAME="575">&#160;</A>
This file contains some X Resources. 
These X resources are already built-in in the tools, so this file
is not read in by TCM. But you can customize with this file the fonts and 
colors of the Motif widgets that TCM uses, by setting these resources 
with different values in your X defaults database. Each string of the 
form ``TCM.resource:definition'' sets a resource. 
See question&nbsp;<A HREF="usersguidenode12.html#XResources">B.18</A> in the FAQ for how exactly you can set 
X resources.

<P>
<LI><TT>TCM_CONFIG/banner.ps</TT>.<A NAME="578">&#160;</A>
PostScript banner page that can be used when you explicitly want to print
a banner page. To use this banner by default you have to 
edit <TT>tcm.conf</TT> or <TT><code>.tcmrc</code></TT>.
<LI><TT>TCM_CONFIG/colorrgb.txt</TT>. This is a text file with the
names of the colors that can be used in TCM, together their 
associated RGB (red, green, blue) values.

it is necessary to append <TT>TCM_LIB</TT> to this variable. 
Otherwise the shared libraries can't be found by TCM. 
In the FAQ in appendix&nbsp;<A HREF="usersguidenode12.html#FAQ">B</A> you will find more
information about shared libraries and this variable.
Also, if your X- or Motif libraries are in a non-default place then
it can be necessary to set this variable.

<P>
<LI><TT>MANPATH</TT>.<A NAME="697">&#160;</A>
You are advised to add <TT>TCM_MAN</TT> to your MANPATH.
Each tool has a short Unix manual page. E.g. <TT>man terd</TT> will show 
the man page of the ER diagramming tool TERD.

<P>
<LI><TT>PATH</TT>.<A NAME="698">&#160;</A>
You are advised to add <TT>TCM_BIN</TT> to your PATH.

<P>
<LI><TT>PRINTER</TT>.<A NAME="699">&#160;</A>
The name of the default printer for printing documents.
This variable can be overridden by the <TT>PrinterName</TT> option 
in the TCM configuration files.

<P>
<LI><TT>TCM_HOME</TT>.<A NAME="700">&#160;</A> 
The parent directory of the directories where the TCM 
binaries, libraries and manual pages are expected to reside if 
no additional TCM environment variables have been set.

<P>
The tools will not start when <TT>TCM_HOME</TT> is not set.
When <TT>TCM_HOME</TT> is set to the wrong directory, the configuration and
help files can not be read, which will be reported upon start up.

<P>

<P>
As of version 2.20 TCM also runs on Windows systems under the 
<A NAME="tex2html30"
 HREF="http://www.cygwin.com/xfree">CYGWIN/XFree86</A>
environment. See the 
<TT>README.cygwin</TT> and the <TT>INSTALL.cygwin</TT> file in the software 
distribution before you install and use TCM under CYGWIN.
<A NAME="612">&#160;</A> <A NAME="613">&#160;</A>
In order to run TCM under CYGWIN all executables in the CYGWIN distribution
will have the <TT>.exe</TT> extension. Also some scripts in <TT>TCM_BIN</TT>
are added or adapted.

1.4.6 Graphical User Interface
</H2> 

<P>
The user interface of TCM complies for a large part with the 
OSF/Motif Style Guide&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="usersguidenode14.html#MotifStyleGuide1.2">15</A>]. 
The user interface is built from the OSF/Motif widget 
set&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="usersguidenode14.html#MotifProgGuide1.2">14</A>]. The result is that user interaction through 
menus, dialogs, buttons, scroll bars and text areas work
in the same way as other Motif applications and environments such as for 
instance Netscape for X Windows and CDE (common desktop environment).
Only the drawing of diagrams and tables itself is quite different
and this part does not make use of Motif.
In any case, the TCM editors should be well-behaved under 
all popular X Window managers, e.g. kde, gnome, fvwm, mwm, etc.
In&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="usersguidenode14.html#MotifUsersGuide1.2">16</A>] you find the specification of the user 
interaction with Motif applications in general, so it is not
necessary to repeat that in this manual.
TCM looks optimal on a full color display and a resolution of at least
an XVGA screen (1024x756). It should still be usable though
on a black and white display and/or an SVGA screen (800x600).
For more detailed information about the other system requirements 
of TCM regarding Motif, X Windows and Unix see appendix&nbsp;<A HREF="usersguidenode12.html#FAQ">B</A>.
