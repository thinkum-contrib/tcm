7. Table Editing
</H1>

<P>
All TCM table editors are very similar. With each table editor
you can create and manipulate textual tables, i.e. tables in which 
the cells are filled with a multi-line text string. 
The table editors offer a lot of layout facilities and TCM has 
special purpose table editors that have constraints built-in for a
specific modeling technique. Furthermore, the tables that are made 
by TCM are kept graphically consistent and TCM keeps track of 
the contents of the tables, which is important when you 
have to do a lot of updates. 

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00910000000000000000">
7.1 Editing Tables</A>
</H1>

<P>
When you start up a table editor, or issue the New command in a table
editor, a new table is created having N x M empty cells (by default, 
N = 7 and M = 7). New rows and columns of empty cells can be created
with the Add Row and Add Column commands. Selected rows and columns can be
deleted with the Delete Rows and Delete Columns commands. These commands
can be issued from the Edit menu.

<P>
If you start up a table editor from the <TT>tcm</TT> start-up tool,
before the main window of the editor is displayed, a dialog window with
a list of text fields is presented. This dialog has four fields: 
number of rows, number of columns, default row height and default 
column width. In these fields the default values are already filled 
in. You can change these values for the editor that will be launched.

<P>
By default, the table is positioned on the drawing area having its top-left
corner a little right below the top-left corner of the drawing area. 
You can reposition the entire table by means of the four arrow
buttons in the bottom-left corner of the main window. Like the diagram editors,
the page boundaries are displayed. If you print the table or save it as
plain PostScript, the table is positioned on the printed page exactly as
it is positioned on the drawing area (what you see is what you print).

<P>
Each row and each column has a sequence number label. These labels are used
to select an entire row or column or to move an entire row or column 
to a new position. These labels cannot be edited. 
In the View menu there is an option to hide the labels. In the 
Printer Options submenu of the Print menu you can choose to print these 
labels or not. See figure&nbsp;<A HREF="usersguidenode9.html#TableSnapShot">7.1</A> for a snap-shot of the table editor.

7.1.1 Definitions</A>
</H2>

<P>
We first give some definitions of the terms that are used in
the rest of this chapter.

<P>
The document that you edit is called a <B>table</B>.<A NAME="7347">&#160;</A>
A table contains a number of <B>cells</B><A NAME="7349">&#160;</A> which are 
<I>invisible</I> rectangles.
The table has a number of <B>rows</B><A NAME="7352">&#160;</A> and a number 
of <B>columns</B><A NAME="7354">&#160;</A>.  Each cell is part of one row 
and of one column. All rows in the table have the same number
of cells and all columns of a table have the same number of cells. 
All cells in a row have the same height and all cells in
a column have the same width. All cells in a row have the same center 
y-coordinate and all cells in a column have the same center 
x-coordinate. All rows and columns are packed, i.e. rows and columns 
cannot overlap and the distance between two rows or two columns is 
zero when there are no other rows between them.

<P>
Each row has a <B>row label</B><A NAME="7356">&#160;</A> which is an uneditable 
label containing the row sequence number (rows are ordered according to 
their y-coordinates), positioned both near the left edge of the first cell 
of the row and near the right edge of the last cell of the row.
Each column has a <B>column label</B><A NAME="7358">&#160;</A> which is an 
uneditable label containing the column sequence number (columns are ordered according 
to their x-coordinates), both positioned above the first cell of the column
and below the last cell of the column.

<P>
Each border line between two cells is called a <B>line piece</B><A NAME="7360">&#160;</A>. 
A line piece has a certain line style: solid, dashed, invisible and so on. 
So, line pieces are the items of a table that can be made visible and 
make the table appear like a grid. Line pieces are either horizontal or vertical. 
Horizontal line pieces are part of the same column as the neighboring cells and
vertical line pieces are part of the same row as the neighboring cells.

<P>
A cell itself is invisible, only its four border lines are possibly visible. 
A cell can contain some piece of <B>cell text</B><A NAME="7362">&#160;</A>.
Cell text is an editable multi-line text string. The cell text is 
positioned in the cell according to the <B>column alignment</B>,
<B>row alignment</B>, <B>text margin width</B> and <B>text margin height</B>
(which are all explained in the next sections). 
A cell can be selected. A selected cell has a rectangle drawn inside 
its four border lines.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00912000000000000000">
7.1.2 Selection Commands</A>
</H2>

<P>
A selected cell is highlighted by an extra black rectangle inside 
the cell boundaries (see figure&nbsp;<A HREF="usersguidenode9.html#TableSnapShot">7.1</A>).
The distance between the selection rectangle and the line pieces
is a pixel or two. Here is a list of all the table editor 
selection commands:

<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Select a single cell</B>.<A NAME="7371">&#160;</A> Click button-1 on 
an unselected cell. This cell becomes the only selected cell of the table.
<LI><B>Select an area of cells</B>.<A NAME="7373">&#160;</A><A NAME="7374">&#160;</A>
Drag with button-2 pressed down.  Note that by this command cells 
are <I>added</I> to the selection, never removed.
<LI><B>Move the selection</B>.<A NAME="7377">&#160;</A> With the four arrow
keys on your keyboard you can move a single-cell or multiple-cell selection
with one cell.
<LI><B>Select a row of cells</B>. Click button-1 on the row label.
The cells in the row become the only selected cells in the table.<A NAME="7379">&#160;</A>
<LI><B>Select a column of cells</B>. Click button-1 on the column label.
The cells in the column become the only selected cells in the table.<A NAME="7381">&#160;</A>
<LI><B>Select all cells</B>. Choose <B>Select All</B> from the Edit menu.<A NAME="7384">&#160;</A>
<LI><B>Add a cell to the selection</B>. Click button-2 on an unselected cell.<A NAME="7386">&#160;</A>
<LI><B>Add a row to the selection</B>.<A NAME="7388">&#160;</A>
Click button-2 on a row label. The row should have one or more unselected cells.
<LI><B>Add a column to the selection</B>.<A NAME="7390">&#160;</A>
Click button-2 on a column label. The column should have one or more unselected cells.
<LI><B>Remove a cell from the selection</B>. Click button-2 on a selected cell.<A NAME="7392">&#160;</A>
<LI><B>Remove a row from the selection</B>.<A NAME="7394">&#160;</A>
Click button-2 on a row label. All cells of the row should be selected.
All cells of the row become unselected.
<LI><B>Remove a column from the selection</B>.<A NAME="7396">&#160;</A>
Click button-2 on a column label. All cells of the column should be selected.
All cells of the column become unselected.
<LI><B>De-select all cells</B>. Click button-1 or button-2 somewhere outside 
the cells, in the drawing area.<A NAME="7398">&#160;</A>

7.1.3 Editing Text
</H2> 

<P>
Text editing works the same for all document editors. 
See section&nbsp;<A HREF="usersguidenode4.html#EditingText">2.5.1</A> 
for the different edit commands and the two different edit modes,
<B>in-line editing</B> and <B>out-line editing</B>.

<P>
For going into edit mode in a table editor, you have to be sure
that only a single cell is selected. When a single cell is selected
and you type in characters or you click with button-1 on the cell
then you enter edit mode. You leave edit mode when you either
click Button-2 with the mouse pointer in any position or you click
button-1 <I>outside</I> the cell that is being edited.

<P>
When a cell text has been edited and the autoresizing<A NAME="7407">&#160;</A>
toggle is on, the cell sizes automatically adapt to the new 
text size. I.e. if the text is too high to fit into the cell, the cell, 
and consequently the entire row is made higher, and if the text is too wide 
to fit into the cell, the cell, and consequently the entire column, 
is made wider. If the cell text becomes less wide or high, and the autoresize 
toggle is on, then the row will be made less high, respectively, 
the column will be made less wide, down to the size that the other texts 
in that row or column still fit.
The <B>default row height</B> and <B>default column width</B> is 
the cell height and cell width when the table is initialized. 
The default row height and column width of the table can be modified in 
the Default Properties submenu of the Properties menu.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00914000000000000000">
7.1.4 Copying and Moving Text</A>
</H2>

<P>
To <B>move a single cell text</B><A NAME="7412">&#160;</A>
from one cell to another, drag and drop it with button-1 from 
an <I>unselected</I> source cell
to a destination cell (just like dragging an edge label in a diagram
editor). The old text of the destination cell will be overwritten.
If the text is dropped somewhere outside a cell or you click button-2 while
dragging, the command will be aborted.

<P>
<B>Copying a single cell text</B><A NAME="7415">&#160;</A>
from one cell to another works in the same manner as moving a text. 
The difference is that the source cell should be <I>selected</I>.

<P>
When the autoresizing toggle is on, cell sizes automatically adapt
to the new situation when text is copied or moved.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00915000000000000000">
7.1.5 Cutting and Pasting Text</A>
</H2>

<P>
The above method for moving or copying cell texts works only for
one cell at the time. To perform this on a whole group of cell texts
there are the Cut, Copy and Paste commands.
To cut cell texts to the cell text <B>buffer</B>, use the<A NAME="7419">&#160;</A> 
<B>Cut Texts </B>&lt;<B>Ctrl+X</B>&gt; command in the Edit menu. 
It clears the texts of the selected cells and copies them into the buffer.
Cut can also be a helpful command when you want to clear some part of the table.
You can copy cell texts to the buffer via the <B>Copy Texts </B>&lt;<B>Ctrl+C</B>&gt; command
in the Edit menu. It copies the text into the buffer, but, unlike Cut, it does not
clear the cells.<A NAME="7422">&#160;</A><A NAME="7423">&#160;</A><A NAME="7424">&#160;</A>

<P>
The cell texts in the buffer can be pasted into the table.
The <B>Paste Texts </B>&lt;<B>Ctrl+Y</B>&gt; command in the Edit menu makes a <B>paste box</B>,
that is attached to the mouse pointer.<A NAME="7427">&#160;</A> 
The size of the paste box is about the size of the cell texts
in the buffer. You can move the paste box with the mouse and click button-1 
somewhere into the table to release it. The cell in which the mouse cursor
(and the top-left of the paste box) was at the time you clicked button-1
becomes the top-left cell of the cell area in which the texts are pasted. 
Which cell is pasted by which cell text is determined by the relative
row and column position (not of the actual size of the texts) when the
original texts were cut or copied into the paste buffer. When you paste,
the texts from the buffer are <I>copied</I> from the buffer into the table. 
The old cell texts are overwritten. If the box is released with the mouse 
pointer somewhere out of the table, the paste command is aborted. If the 
paste box is released (partly) outside the table, only the part that 
covers the table is modified.

</DIV>
<BR>
<P>
To add rows, use the <B>Add Rows</B><A NAME="7438">&#160;</A>
<A NAME="7439">&#160;</A> command in the Edit menu. A 
prompt dialog is popped up asking for the number of rows to be
added (default is 1). In the dialog there is a toggle to choose between
adding the new rows above the selection or appending them to the bottom 
of the table. ``Above the selection'' means one row above the highest 
selected cell in the current selection, or when the selection is empty, 
to the bottom of the table. 

<P>
Adding columns, via the <B>Add Columns</B><A NAME="7441">&#160;</A>
<A NAME="7442">&#160;</A> command, is like adding rows.
There is a choice between adding the new columns to the left of the
current selection or appending to the right of the table.

<P>
After adding rows or columns the table is redrawn including the new 
rows and columns in such a way that the top-left corner of the table
remains at the same position.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00917000000000000000">
7.1.7 Deleting Rows and Columns</A>

<P>
To delete rows, use the <B>Delete Rows</B> command in the 
Edit menu.<A NAME="7445">&#160;</A><A NAME="7446">&#160;</A>
This command deletes every row in which one or more cells are selected.

<P>
To delete columns, use the <B>Delete Columns</B> command in the 
Edit menu.<A NAME="7448">&#160;</A><A NAME="7449">&#160;</A>
This command deletes every column in which one or more cells are selected.

<P>
To delete all cells, use the <B>Delete All</B> command. 
This results into an empty table&nbsp;<A NAME="tex2html132"
 HREF="#foot7451"><SUP>7.1</SUP></A>.
Before everything is deleted, a question dialog asks if you are sure about
what you are doing.

<P>
To remove all unused rows and columns, use the <B>Purge</B>
<A NAME="7453">&#160;</A> command. This command deletes
all rows and columns in which all cells have empty cell texts.

<P>
When you delete rows and/or columns, the table is redrawn in such 
a way that the top-left corner stays at the same position.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00918000000000000000">
7.1.8 Moving Rows and Columns</A>
</H2>

<P>
<B>Moving a row</B> is possible via dragging a row label from the
<A NAME="7456">&#160;</A><A NAME="7457">&#160;</A> source row to the desired 
destination row. If the dragged label is 
released in one of the cells of the destination row, the source row,
where the label came from, is moved to the position of the 
destination row and the destination row and the rows between 
the source and destination row are all shifted one row up 
(when the source row was above the destination row) or one row down 
(when the source row was beneath the destination row)&nbsp;<A NAME="tex2html133"
 HREF="#foot7458"><SUP>7.2</SUP></A>.

<P>
<B>Moving a column</B> works in a similar way.<A NAME="7460">&#160;</A><A NAME="7461">&#160;</A> 
If you drop a column label into a cell of another column, the source 
column moves to that position and the destination column and the 
columns between those two are all shifted one column left or right.

<P>
Note that when you move a row or column, the row and column labels
are not moved with. They stay in the same consecutive order, of course.

<P>
After either command, the resulting table has the same position 
and has the same size.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00919000000000000000">
7.1.9 Sorting Rows and Columns</A>
</H2>

<P>
With the <B>Sort Rows</B> command in the Edit menu you can sort rows 
alphabetically.<A NAME="7464">&#160;</A><A NAME="7465">&#160;</A><A NAME="7466">&#160;</A> 
When the selection is empty, the table is sorted according
to the contents of the first column. If there are selected cells,
sorting is according to the column of the left-most selected cell.
 
With the <B>Sort Columns</B> command in the Edit menu you can sort 
columns<A NAME="7468">&#160;</A><A NAME="7469">&#160;</A>
alphabetically. When the selection is empty, the table is sorted according
to the contents of the first row. If there are selected cells,

7.1.10 Resizing Rows and Columns
</H2>

<P>
Resizing rows and columns can be done by hand
but only when the autoresizing toggle is off.
To resize a row or column, drag a line piece between two rows or
columns: if you enter a line piece between two rows or 
between two columns, the mouse pointer turns into a pair of vertical
respectively horizontal arrows. 
To <B>resize a row</B> you can drag the line piece with button-1 up or down. 
If you drop the line at a new position, the row <I>above</I> the dragged line,
is resized. The part of the table below the row that is resized, will be repositioned
(but not resized).

<P>
To <B>resize a column</B> you can drag a line piece with button-1 left or 
right. If you drop the line at a new position, the column to the <I>left</I> of the 
line that is dragged, is resized.
The part of the table to the right of the column that is resized, 
will be repositioned (but not resized).

The width of each line piece in the table can be set 
individually. The line width ranges from 1 till 6.
When you call Update Line Width from the Properties menu, a pop-up dialog
window is displayed, see figure&nbsp;<A HREF="usersguidenode9.html#TableLineWidthDialog">7.5</A>. The dialog 
window contains two list of toggles, the left one is for the line widths 
and the right one for specifying which lines you want to update. 
This works the same as specifying of which lines you want to change
the line style as described in the previous item.

<P>
The entry <B>Default Line Width</B><A NAME="7532">&#160;</A>
in the Default Properties submenu pops up a dialog window to
set the default line width. Each newly created line piece will have 
this line width.

<P>
<LI><B>Update Text Font</B>.<A NAME="7534">&#160;</A><A NAME="7535">&#160;</A>
This entry pops up a dialog window in which you can select a text font. 
A font consists
of the attributes font family, font style and point size.
For each of the three attributes there is a list of toggle buttons.
Also, each list of toggle buttons in the dialog has an extra check
button called <TT>update</TT> <I>attribute</I> that indicates whether
that font particular attribute should be updated or not.
This makes it possible, for instance, to only change point sizes
or font families of some cell texts but to keep the other font
attributes the same.

<P>
The dialog also shows a preview of some text in the selected font
so you can see how it will look in your diagram.
When you press the <TT>Apply</TT>-button the dialog is dismissed and
of each selected shape the font is updated to the selected font.
Update font is an undo-able command.

<P>
With the <B>Default Text Font</B> entry<A NAME="7540">&#160;</A>
<A NAME="7541">&#160;</A>
from the Default Properties submenu you get a similar dialog window.
Here you can set the default text font. Each new text (i.e. text entered
in an empty cell) will get this font. The row and column sequence labels 
and the page headers and numbers are also drawn in this default font.

<P>
<LI><B>Update Row Alignment</B>.<A NAME="7543">&#160;</A><A NAME="7544">&#160;</A><A NAME="7545">&#160;</A>
The <B>row alignment</B> determines if a text is positioned
near the top, center or bottom of the cell. All cells in a row
have the same row alignment. To change the row alignment of one
or more rows, this entry pops up a dialog window showing toggles
with the three possible alignment types: Top, Center and Bottom. 
If you select one of these, and press <TT>Apply</TT>, the alignment of all rows 
in which one more cells are selected, is changed to this new alignment. 
Update row alignment is an undo-able command.

<P>
The default row alignment can be set via <B>Default Row Alignment</B>
entry from the Default Properties submenu.<A NAME="7549">&#160;</A>
When a new row is created, it will have a certain text alignment (top, center
or bottom) which is visible when the row contains one or more cell texts. You 
can set the default row alignment with a similar pop-up window as Update
Row Alignment. When you change the default row alignment, all new rows
receive this alignment as well as all the rows that contain no cell texts.

<P>
<LI><B>Update Column Alignment</B>.<A NAME="7551">&#160;</A><A NAME="7552">&#160;</A><A NAME="7553">&#160;</A>
The <B>column alignment</B> determines if a text is positioned
near the left, center or right of the cell. All cells in a column
have the same column alignment. To change the column alignment
of one or more columns, this entry pops up a dialog window showing toggles 
with the three possible alignment types: Left, Center and Right. 
If you select one of these, and press <TT>Apply</TT>, the alignment of 
all columns in which one more cells are selected, is changed 
to this new alignment. Update column alignment is an undo-able command.

<P>
The default column alignment can be changed via the entry
<B>Default Column Alignment</B> from the Default Properties 
submenu,<A NAME="7557">&#160;</A> similar to how you
change the default row alignment.

<P>
<LI><B>Set/Unset Text Underlining</B>
<A NAME="7559">&#160;</A><A NAME="7560">&#160;</A>
This option sets/unsets (toggles) the text underlining of the selected 
cells.

<P>

The following default table properties can be set via the Default
Properties submenu of the Properties menu:

<P>
<UL>
<P>
<LI><B>Text Margin Width</B>.<A NAME="7564">&#160;</A><A NAME="7565">&#160;</A>
All cells of a table have the same <B>margin width</B> which is the 
minimal distance between the cell texts and the vertical lines 
of the table. You can update this distance via the entry 
Text Margin Width of the Default Properties submenu and a slider pop-up 
dialog is displayed. If, after the update, some of the texts do not fit 
into their cells and the autoresizing toggle is on, these cells are resized.

<P>
<LI><B>Text Margin Height</B>.<A NAME="7568">&#160;</A><A NAME="7569">&#160;</A>
All cells have the same <B>margin height</B> which is the minimal distance
between the cell texts and the horizontal lines of the table. 
You can update this distance via the entry Text Margin Height of the 
Default Properties submenu and a slider pop-up dialog is displayed.
If, after the update, some of the texts do not fit into
their cells and the autoresizing toggle is on, these cells are resized.

<P>
<LI><B>Default Row Height</B>.<A NAME="7572">&#160;</A>
All rows have at least this height. Every new row that is created
has this height and if you resize a row by hand (when 
autoresizing is off), you cannot make the row less high then this
height. This entry pops-up a slider dialog for inspecting and updating
the default row height. Furthermore, when the autoresize toggle is on,
autoresizing is applied to the rows.

<P>
<LI><B>Default Column Width</B>.<A NAME="7574">&#160;</A>
All columns have at least this width. Every new column that is created
has this width and if you resize a column by hand (when 
autoresizing is off), you cannot make the column less wide then this
width. This entry pops-up a slider dialog for inspecting and updating
the default column width. Furthermore, when the autoresize toggle is on,
autoresizing is applied to the columns.

<P>
<LI><B>Default Number of Rows</B>.<A NAME="7576">&#160;</A>
When a new table is created on start-up or by the New command or when 
the table was empty and the first column is created, the table 
will have a default number of rows. You can inspect
and update this number via a pop-up slider dialog called from this menu entry.

<P>
<LI><B>Default Number of Columns</B>.<A NAME="7578">&#160;</A>
When a new table is created on start-up or by the New command or when 
the table was empty and the first row is created, the table will have a 
default number of columns. You can inspect
and update this number via a pop-up slider dialog called from this menu entry.

7.1.13 Miscellaneous Commands</A>
</H2>

<P>
<UL>
<P>
<LI>The <B>Cell annotation</B> command from the properties
menu pops up a text edit dialog<A NAME="7583">&#160;</A>
in which you can type arbitrary text to annotate a cell 
in the table. See section&nbsp;<A HREF="usersguidenode4.html#TextEditDialog">2.5</A> for using the 
text edit dialogs.
<LI><B>Find</B>.<A NAME="7586">&#160;</A> 
With the Find menu entry in the Search menu you call
a dialog by which you can search for some text in the table.
The find dialog is described in section&nbsp;<A HREF="usersguidenode4.html#TextEditor">2.5.3</A>.
From this dialog you can <B>find the next text</B> or
<B>find all texts</B> that matches the string to find.
In the first case the first cell that is found is
selected and the scrollbars of the main window are moved to
center the cell in the main window. When you click <TT>Find Next</TT>
again, the next cell is selected (top down, from left to right).
When you choose <TT>Find All</TT>, all cells that contain a string
that matches is selected. The find dialog contains two toggles,
one to determine that the matching has to be case sensitive (default off) 
and the other to determine that a substring of the cell has to 
match (default on).

<P>
<LI><B>Replace</B>.<A NAME="7593">&#160;</A> 
With the <B>Replace</B> menu entry in the Search menu you call
a dialog by which you can replace texts in the table.
The replace dialog is described in section&nbsp;<A HREF="usersguidenode4.html#TextEditor">2.5.3</A>.
It has a find next command that works the same as in the
find dialog. Furthermore, the replace dialog has a <B>replace next</B>
and a <B>replace all</B> button. Replace next means that in the next
cell (the cell that is found with find next) the text
strings that match are substituted with the string to replace
(that is the second string filled in in the dialog).
In the case of replace all this happens to the entire table in 
one command (global substitution).

<P>
Note that find and replace work on entire cells. But keep in mind that in a 
cell, the cell text could match the string to find or the string to replace 
multiple times (at least when you search a substring). When you want to 
find and replace within a single cell, you should load that text label first in
the out-line text editor and then do find and replace within the out-line edit
dialog.

7.3 The Transaction Decomposition Table Editor (TTDT)
</H1>

<P>
According to this modeling technique, the entries in row 0 contain 
transaction names.  The entries in column 0 contain object class (or
entity type) names. The other entries contain zero or more action names.
To graphically separate row 0 and column 0 from the rest of the
table, the initial table separates them by default by a dual line. 
The editor does not check for that layout, however.
For an example see figure&nbsp;<A HREF="usersguidenode9.html#TDTExample">7.7</A>.

According to this modeling technique,
this table has five columns. The entries in row 0 are initialized with
the labels <TT>Create</TT>, <TT>Read</TT>, <TT>Update</TT> and <TT>Delete</TT>.
The entries in column 0 contain transaction names.
The other entries contain zero or more object class (or entity type)
names. To graphically separate row 0 and column 0 from the rest of the
table, the initial table separates them by a dual line. 
The editor does not check for that layout, however.

<P>
This kind of the table is also called <I>Function-Entity Matrix</I>
in&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="usersguidenode14.html#Wieringa96-01">22</A>].
According to this modeling technique, the entries in row 0 contain transaction names.
The entries in column 0 contain object class (or entity type) names.
The other entries contain <B>CRUD</B> strings:<A NAME="7654">&#160;</A>
a string containing zero or one occurrences of the
characters C, R, U and D, and that does not contain any other
character. To separate row 0 and column 0 from the rest, 
the initial table separates them from the rest by a dual line. 
The editor does not check for that layout, however.

<P>
In&nbsp;[<A
