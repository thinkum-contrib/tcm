<P>
Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="developersguidenode5.html#fig:gui_libs">4.1</A> shows the relationships between the
built-in X, Motif and Unix libraries and an arbitrary X/Motif 
application.  All X, Motif and Unix libraries have a C interface 
(functions, defines, typedefs, structs, enums, unions and variables).
When a library is depicted on top of another library, this means 
that a library is implemented by means of the interface provided
by the underlying layer. You are referred to the X and Motif
books and manuals in the list of references at the end of this text.

<P>
The TCM X/Motif user interface is restricted to that part of the source
(classes and functions) that directly uses the Motif, Xt and Xlib 
libraries. That part consists of most of the classes in the <TT>src/ui</TT> 
directory and <I>some</I> of the classes in the other editor libraries.
The names of the editor specific user interface classes all 
end on <TT>Window</TT> or <TT>Stubs</TT>, such as <A NAME="tex2html113"
 HREF="../sourcecode/ERWindow.html"><TT>ERWindow</TT></A>, 
<A NAME="tex2html114"
 HREF="../sourcecode/DFWindow.html"><TT>DFWindow</TT></A>
and 
<A NAME="tex2html115"
 HREF="../sourcecode/DiagramStubs.html"><TT>DiagramStubs</TT></A>, 
<A NAME="tex2html116"
 HREF="../sourcecode/TableStubs.html"><TT>TableStubs</TT></A>
etc. 
The window classes are all specializations of the abstract class 
<A NAME="tex2html117"
 HREF="../sourcecode/MainWindow.html"><TT>ui/MainWindow</TT></A>.
The stub classes contain functions that are called from the user interface 
widgets (menus, push buttons, text fields etc.) and these functions in turn 
call application specific functions of non-GUI objects.

<P>
The <A NAME="tex2html118"
 HREF="../sourcecode/DrawingArea.html"><TT>ed/DrawingArea</TT></A>
class 
is not part of libgui but of libeditor because it also has application specific 
behavior (albeit at a high level). The drawing area needs a viewer class (a 
descendent of class <A NAME="tex2html119"
 HREF="../sourcecode/Viewer.html"><TT>ed/Viewer</TT></A>).
The viewer class should provide functions that are called when mouse
buttons are pressed or dragged in the drawing area, when the mouse pointer
is moved or when a characters are typed in while the mouse pointer is
in the drawing area.

<P>
When asked what code contains X/Motif calls (and forms the GUI) then 
the answer is: almost all code of <A NAME="tex2html120"
 HREF="../../src/ui">src/ui</A>, 
all classes that end on <TT>Window</TT> or end on <TT>Stubs</TT> and the 
DrawingArea class.

<P>
The entire TCM distribution of the current version consists of about 450 
classes and about 83000 lines of code (source and headers files, 
including white spaces and comments, but excluding the 20-line header 
part of the GNU General Public License).
The X/Motif dependent part is about 19000 lines of code.
This is the part that should be rewritten when TCM is translated to
a non-X Windows environment.

<P>
The TCM user interface is more or less insulated into a restricted 
part of the source code, put in a number of C++ classes that are
clearly distinguishable from the rest. But 
the user interface code is spread over all the TCM libraries 
(except libglobal). The reason for this organization is that factoring 
out the commonalities between all different tools was for us more
important than a complete separation of the entire application code on 
one hand and the entire user interface code on the other. This means that 
each diagram editor has its own specific node and edge buttons. The code 
for creating tiled buttons in general is part of libgui but the specific 
initialization is done in the code of a specific diagram editor.

<P>
The approach of factoring out commonalities was a design for <B>evolution</B>
and that has proved to work for TCM. It makes it
relatively easy to add new tools or modify individual existing tools 
while maintaining a stable core of libraries and unrelated tools. When 
features are added to some library or to some tool, all tools that are 
included in the area of that library or tool (see figure&nbsp;<A HREF="developersguidenode4.html#fig:src_organization">3.1</A>) 
are also updated minimizing the risk of code redundancy or inconsistencies.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00520000000000000000">
4.2 User interface implementation</A>
</H1> 

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00521000000000000000">
4.2.1 Overview</A>
</H2>

<P>
Like all X11 applications, the TCM tools are event driven. This means they
have the following basic structure:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT>1.
<DD>Create the widgets.
<DT>2.
<DD>Register the event handlers for these widgets.
<DT>3.
<DD>Go into the main event loop.
<DT>4.
<DD>Activate the appropriate event handler when a specific event
occurs on a specific widget.
<DT>5.
<DD>Return to the main event loop when done.
</DL>
<P>
When a TCM tool is started the widgets that form the main window are created. 
The class <A NAME="tex2html121"
 HREF="../sourcecode/EditWindow.html"><TT>ed/EditWindow</TT></A>
and its specializations contain the functions to create the 
constituent parts of the main window. These widgets have one or more so-called 
<B>call-back functions</B>: the widget reacts to a certain set of X events 
(that set is built-in) and when such an event occurs a user-supplied action,
in the form of ordinary C functions, will be called. In our implementation we do not
use ordinary C functions but instead we provide C++ static member functions.

<P>
An exception to this use of callbacks, is the drawing area widget 
which, by default, does not react on the events that are needed to 
draw pictures as we like to 
do in TCM. Therefore, so-called <I>translations</I> are used, an X-Toolkit data 
structure to define some specified mapping of X events to user 
supplied actions. All details of translations and drawing area events
are hidden in the <A NAME="tex2html122"
 HREF="../sourcecode/DrawingArea.html"><TT>ed/DrawingArea</TT></A>
class.

<P>
Most pop-up window <A NAME="tex2html123"
 HREF="../sourcecode/Dialog.html">dialog widgets</A>
are created during initialization. 
When they are popped up they do not have to be created (which is much
faster) and when these dialogs are dismissed they are not destroyed, 
but they are simply kept unmanaged (invisible).
An exception to this are so-called <A NAME="tex2html124"
 HREF="../sourcecode/MessageDialog.html">message dialogs</A>, for error and warning 
messages etc. These are created on the fly because we can not determine
in advance how many of which kind will be necessary.

<P>
A special kind of message dialog is the <A NAME="tex2html125"
 HREF="../sourcecode/QuestionDialog.html">question dialog</A>
which is application 
modal. This means that the user can only respond to this dialog and other 
user actions in the applications are prohibited. This is necessary when the 
application has to have an answer before it can proceed (e.g. 
the `save before quit?' dialog).

<P>
The main event loop is built-in in Motif, as well as the calling
of the event handlers (via callback or translation).

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00522000000000000000">
4.2.2 Application startup</A>
</H2>

<P>
In contrast with an ordinary C program the editors don't start by directly 
entering the <TT>main()</TT> function. Instead, each editor is compiled with 
a distinct file <TT>??editor.c</TT>, e.g. <A NAME="tex2html126"
 HREF="../../src/sd/gd/gdeditor.c"><TT>gdeditor.c</TT></A>
for TGD. In that 
file two global objects are created (but the two instance variables are 
not visible outside this file). For example:
<PRE>
 
Application *app = new Application("Tcm");
MainWindow *mw = new GDWindow("Tcm");
</PRE> 
This means that the very first thing that is done on start-up is
calling the constructor <BR> <TT>Application::Application</TT>
and then the constructor <TT>GDWindow::GDWindow</TT>.
So, for each editor first an instance of class <A NAME="tex2html127"
 HREF="../sourcecode/Application.html"><TT>ui/Application</TT></A>
is created and then an instance of an editor specific 
main window class is created (but both are not initialized yet).
<A NAME="tex2html128"
 HREF="../sourcecode/MainWindow.html">MainWindow</A>
and Application are 
both part of libgui. Specific main window classes such as 
<A NAME="tex2html129"
 HREF="../sourcecode/GDWindow.html">GDWindow</A>
are specializations of 
MainWindow and are included in the specific diagram editor sources.

<P>
There should be just one instance of class Application per editor instance, 
which can be accessed via the global variable named <TT>theApplication</TT>.
The application opens the X display, sets the color map and 
does some other things that are applicable for the entire application. 
Furthermore, the application class keeps track of a list of 
the application (main) 
windows. The current TCM implementation is limited to a single main 
window (the other windows are made as pop-up dialog windows) but in principle 
the framework of libgui can be utilized in programs that have
multiple main windows. 

<P>
After the creation of both class instances, the function
<TT>main(argc, argv)</TT> is entered in which 
<TT>theApplication-&gt;Initialize(argc, argv)</TT> is called. 
The <TT>main</TT> function is generic and is part of libgui.
The application then creates an object config of type <A NAME="tex2html130"
 HREF="../sourcecode/Config.html">Config</A>, which reads in the configuration file and keeps 
tracks of various editor defaults. Then the application 
initializes the Xt application context and subsequently
calls the main window initialization functions. 

<P>
The main window initialization consists of the
creation of the main window widgets. 
After the main window widgets are created, some other important
objects are created (in the <A NAME="tex2html131"
 HREF="../sourcecode/DiagramWindow.html">DiagramWindow</A>
or <A NAME="tex2html132"
 HREF="../sourcecode/TableWindow.html">TableWindow</A>
class), 
notably:

<P>
<UL>
<LI><TT>printer</TT> of class <A NAME="tex2html133"
 HREF="../sourcecode/Printer.html"><TT>ed/Printer</TT></A>. This object keeps
track of all page and print options and takes care of printing
and generating PostScript.
<LI><TT>helper</TT> of class <A NAME="tex2html134"
 HREF="../sourcecode/Helper.html"><TT>ed/Helper</TT></A>. This object shows
the on-line help messages. It reads the help messages from file.
<LI><TT>document</TT> of an editor specific specialization of the
abstract class <A NAME="tex2html135"
 HREF="../sourcecode/Document.html"><TT>ed/Document</TT></A>, depending on the base class of the 
main window. E.g. <A NAME="tex2html136"
 HREF="../sourcecode/GDWindow.html">GDWindow</A>
creates 
<A NAME="tex2html137"
 HREF="../sourcecode/GDDiagram.html">GDDiagram</A>, 
<A NAME="tex2html138"
 HREF="../sourcecode/DFWindow.html">DFWindow</A>
creates
<A NAME="tex2html139"
 HREF="../sourcecode/DFDiagram.html">DFDiagram</A>
etc. The document 
object keeps track of the document information (like document name, author etc.) 
and takes amongst others care of loading documents from file and saving them 
to file.
<LI>Depending on the kind of document that is created some
extra objects are created such as a <A NAME="tex2html140"
 HREF="../sourcecode/Graph.html">graph object</A>
for diagram
editors (a <A NAME="tex2html141"
 HREF="../sourcecode/GDGraph.html">GDGraph</A>
in the case of TGD), 
that manages the nodes and edges of the document and a 
<A NAME="tex2html142"
 HREF="../sourcecode/DiagramViewer.html">viewer object</A>
(<A NAME="tex2html143"
 HREF="../sourcecode/GDViewer.html">GDViewer</A>
in the case of TGD) 
that manages in the case of a diagram editor one or more views containing a set of 
graphical shapes. In the case of a table editor the
<A NAME="tex2html144"
 HREF="../sourcecode/TableViewer.html">viewer object</A>
manages 
the rows and columns of the table.
</UL>
<P>
These objects (of which exactly one instance exist per 
main window), will be supplied as parameter to the Motif 
callback functions&nbsp;<A NAME="tex2html145"
 HREF="#foot486"><SUP>4.1</SUP></A>. The callback function are 
static member functions of one of the stub classes. When the 
stub is called then the object is casted to the right type 
(because the parameters to stubs are simply pointers)
and the appropriate class member of this object is called 
possibly with some other parameters that are supplied to
the stub.

<P>
And finally, after the creation of the main window, the application 
object and the other main editor objects, the X main 
event loop is entered, giving X the control.

See figure&nbsp;<A HREF="developersguidenode5.html#fig:mainwindow">4.2</A> for the basic main window's widget structure.
The boxes are Motif widgets (widget type and name between parentheses). 
The arrows connect widgets with their parents. The root is the top-level
shell (TCM). To be more exact: the figure shows the main window of the 
generic diagram editor, TGD. The other diagram editors look almost
the same, the main difference are their node and edge buttons.
The table editors are almost similar too but they do not have 
node and edge buttons of course.

<P>
When libeditor.so is compiled with the option <TT>-DDUMPWIDGETTREE</TT>, 
a textual representation of the widget structure will be written to standard output
when the editor is started (its output is also used for making 
this figure).

<P>
The details about creation of the widgets can be found in the classes 
<A NAME="tex2html147"

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00524000000000000000">
4.2.4 Calling functions from the user interface</A>
</H2>

<P>
Menus are created by the constructor function of class 
<A NAME="tex2html152"
 HREF="../sourcecode/Menu.html"><TT>ui/Menu</TT></A>.
For an example for how to create a menu see <TT>dg/DiagramWindow::CreateMenuBar</TT>.

<P>
The items of a menu are specified by means of the 
<A NAME="tex2html153"
 HREF="../sourcecode/MenuItem.html"><TT>ui/MenuItem</TT></A>
class.
A menu contains a list of menu items, which can be supplied to the menu
constructor function. The menus common to all drawing editors are made in 
<A NAME="tex2html154"
 HREF="../sourcecode/DrawWindow.html"><TT>ed/DrawWindow</TT></A>, the
menus common to all diagram editors are made in 
<A NAME="tex2html155"
 HREF="../sourcecode/DiagramWindow.html"><TT>dg/DiagramWindow</TT></A>
and the menus common to all table editors are made in 
<A NAME="tex2html156"
 HREF="../sourcecode/TableWindow.html"><TT>tb/TableWindow</TT></A>.
Likewise, menus that are specific for a single editor, are made 
in the corresponding main window class.

<P>
One of the fields of a MenuItem is the function that will be called when
the menu item is selected. These functions are called stubs and have to 
be static C++ class members. The functions that are supplied are all part of a 
<TT>...Stubs</TT> class which consist entirely of these static functions.
Menu items also have a so-called callback data.
The callback data is always used to pass a pointer to the object
whose class member should be called. For example, the Print menu item
has as callback function the Print function of 
<A NAME="tex2html157"
 HREF="../sourcecode/EditStubs.html"><TT>ed/Editstubs</TT></A>
and as callback data a pointer to a printer of class 
<A NAME="tex2html158"
 HREF="../sourcecode/Printer.html"><TT>ed/Printer</TT></A>.
In the stubs function <TT>Printer::Print</TT> is called.

<P>
You can also call functions via the other main window widgets, for instance
the diagram name text field or the node and edge toggle buttons.
This works similar as with menus. You have to supply a callback function 
(<TT>XtCallBack</TT>) after the widget creation. These callbacks are also 
listed in the stub classes.

<P>

4.3 Xlib drawing</A>
</H1> 

<P>
This is a very short introduction to drawing lines etc. in Xlib. For the 
rest you are referred to the documentation mentioned in the references.

<P>
X has 16 drawing modes (so called raster operations). A technique for
simulating graphical objects moving or stretching (like resizing a box
or a ``rubber band'' line), is to set the Graphics Context
to the eXclusive-OR raster operation mode. The Graphics Context 
is an Xlib data structure which determines how an object will be drawn
when a drawing routine is called (XDrawLine, XDrawRectangle etc.).
In XOR mode, the new destination pixel is produced by the exclusive 
or of the old destination pixel with the source pixel.
In this mode, you can easily draw and erase a figure. You draw a figure
to let it appear, and when you redraw it, you erase it. By sequencing
drawing and redrawing you can simulating an object being moved or
dragged. Furthermore, in XOR mode, objects can overlap each other
without damaging each other. The overlapping part is then white, and
when one of the objects is moved or removed it will be redrawn, so
that the overlapping part will appear black again. 
All details of drawing graphics with Xlib is hidden in 
the <A NAME="tex2html159"
 HREF="../sourcecode/XGrafport.html"><TT>XGrafport</TT></A>
class. 
An XGrafport has as attributes some GCs.

<P>
Note that each Xlib drawing operation is performed twice: one on the 
drawing area (window) and one on a Pixmap that serves as a backup 
store. This is needed because X does not automatically save the window 
contents when the window is overlapped or resized.

<P>
All the entire Xlib drawing functionality is hidden in the
<TT>ui/XGrafport</TT> class which is a descendant of the abstract
<A NAME="tex2html160"
 HREF="../sourcecode/Grafport.html"><TT>ui/Grafport</TT></A>
class. 
Because XGrafport only uses a reference to the X Display and an X Window it 
can be used rather easily in any 2D drawing program under X (it uses Xlib 
but it does not use Motif nor the other classes of libgui that use Motif).
