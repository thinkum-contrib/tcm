This program converts text files into PostScript.
There are lots of options, but there are special options for the two most
common uses:
	-1	one column, portrait mode
	-2	two columns, landscape mode

Just type `make' to compile.
If you don't use A4 paper you may want to change the defines for PAGE_HEIGHT
and PAGE_WIDTH.  These are in 10ths of inches.  If you do that, it may be that
you don't get 66 lines on a page anymore.
