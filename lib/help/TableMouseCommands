The following table edit commands are issued by using the mouse and/or 
the keyboard in the drawing area. We have grouped them into selection 
commands, text edit commands and movement commands.

SELECTION COMMANDS.

---------------------
Click button-1 on a cell. A selected cell has an extra rectangle drawn 
in it.

-----------------------------------------
Drag button-2 over the cells. Note that by this command cells are added
to the selection, never removed.

become the only selected cells in the table.

cells are unselected.

Remove a row or column to selection.

unselected.


 
TEXT EDIT COMMANDS.
==================
 
Go into edit mode.
------------------
For getting into edit mode make sure that the cell that you want to 
edit is the only selected cell of the table. When you move the mouse
pointer into the single selected cell, the mouse pointer turns into 
an I-shape. By clicking button-1 on the cell or just typing the first 
character you go into edit mode.
 
There are two edit modes: in-line editing and out-line editing. In-line
editing takes place directly in the drawing area. Out-line editing 
takes place in a separate window with a text editor that is popped up
when the edit mode is entered. You can indicate which of the two
possible edit modes has to be used by a toggle button labeled in-line
editor.

Edit text.
----------
In both in-line as the out-line editor you can type in any printable
character as text and move the edit cursor around with the arrow
buttons or by clicking with button-1 at the desired cursor position.
See the user manual for the more advanced text edit features.
 
Leave edit mode.
-----------------
From the in-line editor you leave edit mode by clicking button-1
outside the cell that is being edited or by clicking button-2 at any 
position of the drawing area. The text that is edited will be updated, 
and when the autoresizing toggle is on, the row and/or the column of the
cell will be resized to make it fit the text that it contains. After 
the text is updated, you can still undo the update including the 
autoresizing, by issuing the undo command from the Edit menu.
 
 
 
MOVEMENT COMMANDS.
==================

Move a cell text.
-----------------
Drag and drop with button-1 the text of an unselected cell.

Copy a cell text.
-----------------
Drag and drop with button-1 the text of a selected cell text.

Move a row or column.
---------------------
Drag and drop with button-1 a row or column label. Move the label 
of the row or column into the row or column at the desired position.

Resize a row or column.
-----------------------
Resizing a row or column with the mouse is only possible when
the autoresizing toggle is off. When it is off you can drag and
drop with button-1 a cell boundary. To resize a row drag the 
boundary below the row up or down. To resize a column drag the
boundary to the right of the column left or right.

Table rows and columns have a minimal height and width, which
can be seen and changed in the menu called Table. Cells can
not be made smaller than this minimal size.
