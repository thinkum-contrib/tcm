Welcome to TCM!

 
What is TCM?
------------------
TCM (Toolkit for Conceptual Modeling) is a suite of graphical editors 
for a number of graphical notation systems that are used in software 
specification methods. The notations can be used to represent the 
conceptual structure of the software - hence the name of the suite.

For each notation that TCM supports there is a distinct editor. 
In the startup program you see for each editor a colored button with the 
name of the editor and next to it the corresponding notation system. 
By clicking this button you start up an editor.
