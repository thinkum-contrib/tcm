To start up a tool, simply press the corresponding button.
For table editors, first a dialog is presented which asks for
some extra parameters: the initial number of rows and columns
and the initial sizes of the cells. The other tools are started 
immediately.

The processes of the running tools are independent from this program.
So 'Quit' from the File menu kills only this program, but not 
the other running tools. So be careful: each time you press a
button, a new editor is launched.

In the File menu you can set the starting (project) directory.
In the View menu you can set the initial and maximal size of the 
drawing areas of the editors that are started from this program.
