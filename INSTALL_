BINARY TAR.GZ DISTRIBUTIONS.
============================

To install a TCM distribution (tar.gz file) with binaries: unzip and untar 
the TCM distribution by:

tar xzvfp <filename>                         or 
gunzip -c <filename> | tar xvfp -            or
zcat <filename> | tar xvfp -            

This creates a new directory named tcm-<version>/ in the current
directory.
 
Every user of TCM should set the TCM_HOME environment variable to the
directory where TCM is installed. It is recommended that they add
$TCM_HOME/bin to their PATH and add $TCM_HOME/man to their MANPATH
environment variable.
 
The distributions for Solaris contain shared object libraries. If you
have one of these distributions and you have TCM installed in a directory
other than /opt/tcm, each user should set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH
variable like this: LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$TCM_HOME/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
Users of Linux do not need to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
 
Finally, test the TCM startup tool called tcm and at least one of the editors
(e.g. tgd, tefd, tssd etc).
 
To configure amongst others the path names of some external Unix programs that 
are used by TCM you can modify the $TCM_HOME/lib/tcm.conf file.

For more information you are referred to our extensive user's guide which 
can be found via $TCM_HOME/doc/usersguide.html and in
$TCM_HOME/doc/usersguide-<version>.ps.gz (gzipped-Postscript).


BINARY RPM DISTRIBUTIONS.
=========================

These distributions are made and tested with Redhat 6.0 and Redhat 6.1.

Install the distribution by:
rpm --install tcm-<version>.i386.rpm

Or upgrade an existing distribution by:
rpm --upgrade tcm-<version>.i386.rpm

By default TCM is installed in /opt/tcm. With the rpm option
'--prefix <dir>' you can install it in a different directory. Some of the 
documentation will be installed by default in /usr/doc/tcm-<version>.

There are two sorts of binary RPMs. One contains the name 'statmotif'
and the other 'dynmotif'. The first sort has Motif statically 
linked into the executables. The 'dynmotif' RPMs are dynamically
linked against Motif 1.2. It uses the libXm.so (version 1.2) of Motif
or Lesstif on your system.

The RPM installation creates some initialization scripts for TCM in 
/etc/profile.d. It is therefore not necessary to set yourself environment
variables like for the tar.gz distribution.
You only have to login again before you start using TCM.


SOURCE TAR.GZ DISTRIBUTIONS
===========================

You untar the file in the same way as for binary distributions and you
set the variables $TCM_HOME and $PATH.

Go to $TCM_HOME and enter 'make'. This tries to configure some things
and then writes some instructions to standard output for how to proceed.

If the above method does not work well on your system or you are only
interested in compiling some part of the sources then do the following:

1. Change to the directory ./src of the distribution.
2. Make a softlink named Config.tmpl to Config.tmpl_YOURPLATFORM.
3. Check and, if necessary, update the settings in Config.tmpl.
4. Make a softlink named Makefile to Makefile_YOURCOMPILER.
5. make clean 
6. make depend
7. make all or make <someexecutable> or make <somelibrary>.
   (step 7 can be repeated an infinite number of times).


Additional technical information about compiling the software and
about the internal structure of the software, see the document
$TCM_HOME/doc/developersguide/index.html or 
$TCM_HOME/doc/developersguide-<version>.ps.gz (gzipped PostScript).


USER INTERFACE
==============

For compiling TCM you either need a developer version of Motif or the 
free Motif-clone Lesstif (www.lesstif.org). 

For running TCM binaries you need a Motif or Lesstif runtime library, 
unless you have downloaded a distribution with 'statmotif' as
substring in the file name.

The looks of TCM is sometimes subject of discussion. For users who 
liked how TCM looked last century there is an option in tcm.conf:
	{ GUIstyle Classic }


MOUSE ISSUES
==============

TCM needs a 3-button mouse. The left and middle buttons are the most 
essential for drawing nodes and edges and the right button is only used 
for a pop-up menu. Most 2-button mice emulate the middle button by 
pressing both buttons at the same time or by pressing the left button 
together with the Shift- or Ctrl-key. A possibly better solution is to 
change the function of the right and middle mouse button with: 
xmodmap -e "pointer = 1 3 2".

If you're using a so-called 5-button mouse (IntelliMouse with wheel-button), 
you can change the function of the right and middle mouse button with: 
xmodmap -e "pointer = 1 3 2 4 5". 

! NEW !
As of version 1.98 the middle mouse button is not required anymore.
Pressing or dragging with the left mouse button while you are pressing the
Shift-key has the same effect as pressing or dragging the middle button. 


FONT AND COLOR ISSUES
=====================

In $TCM_HOME/lib/tcm.conf you can see which (types of) fonts are used for 
the TCM documents by default. If you wish some other font you can edit this
file (or better, put the options in a personal file $HOME/.tcmrc ). 

TCM uses scalable X fonts. If these are not installed or don't look good
for your tastes then you can tell TCM to work with unscalable fonts by 
specifying:
       { ScalableFonts False }. 
If you wish fonts of a certain foundry, e.g. only Adobe fonts, then specify 
that with the following line in $TCM_HOME/lib/tcm.conf or $HOME/.tcmrc :
       { FontFoundry Adobe }

In $TCM_HOME/lib/TCM you can see which fonts and colors are being used for
the Motif GUI of TCM. These can be overridden too if you wish. Changes to 
these defaults can be added to your .Xdefaults or .Xresources file or 
loaded for the current X session with the 'xrdb' command.


EXPORT FORMATS
==============

TCM is able to generate Xfig format and PNG graphics format from a diagram.
For the generation of PNG we rely on the fig2dev tool. You should have a fairly
recent version of transfig (fig2dev is part of transfig). If you want to download 
a recent version of fig2dev and you use Linux with RPM support, you could get one 
of the 'transfig' packages from http://www.rpmfind.net. The sources can be 
downloaded from: ftp://epb1.lbl.gov/xfig/. At these sites you can also find
the sources or binaries of the Xfig drawing program.
